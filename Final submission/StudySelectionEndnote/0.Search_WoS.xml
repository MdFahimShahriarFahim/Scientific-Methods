UAV's observation range and communication methods between UAVs have a significant impact on multi-UAV collaboration strategy. For this purpose, we study the multi-UAV observation range dynamic control method and the optimal inter-UAV communication method. Our approach is to design a multi-UAV joint observation, communication, policy, and service collaboration protocol and study the optimization method of the protocol. We propose an expert-guided deep reinforcement learning framework to optimize this protocol. Each UAV's optimal radar observation range and inter-UAV communication method are learned using an information entropy value decomposition method. Through our observation and communication method, multi-UAV are able to obtain the most valuable information. Experiments demonstrate that our method can improve MEC's service coverage by 9.38%-21.88% compared to the classical MARL algorithm. Our method improves the radar observation efficiency and communication efficiency by 3.05%-38.9% and 8.55%-22.03%, respectively. The results show that this method improves multi-UAV energy utilization.</abstract><remote-database-name>Clarivate Analytics Web of Science</remote-database-name><language>English</language><custom1>Los Alamitos</custom1><custom3>2022 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILITY, SENSING AND NETWORKING, MSN</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, Jae Won</author><author>Ko, Young-Bae</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Q-learning based Stepwise Routing Protocol for Multi-UAV Networks</title><secondary-title>3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication (IEEE ICAIIC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (IEEE ICAIIC 2021)</full-title></periodical><pages>307-309</pages><keywords><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicle</keyword><keyword>Multi-UAV Network</keyword><keyword>Q-learning based routing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72817-638-3</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICAIIC51459.2021.9415265</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A multi-UAV network is a wireless multi-hop network consisting of several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that are supposed to communicate with a centralized control center. Due to high mobility, such a dynamic network faces frequent changes in network topology, resulting in poor wireless link quality and even frequent disconnection. UAVs' computational capability is also bound to a limited threshold. Therefore, it is important to design a routing protocol that works in a lightweight and adaptive manner. We propose an intelligent routing protocol for Multi-UAV Networks that ensure minimum hops to the destination and better link quality by employing the Q-learning technique. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated through the OPNET simulator. A preliminary result shows that it can improve the routing performance in terms of the end-to-end delivery and packet delivery ratio, compared to the de facto ad hoc routing protocol.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (IEEE ICAIIC 2021)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lizzio, Fausto Francesco</author><author>Capello, Elisa</author><author>Guglieri, Giorgio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Implementation and Performance Evaluation of a Consensus Protocol for Multi-UAV Formation with Communication Delay</title><secondary-title>International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2022 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (ICUAS)</full-title></periodical><pages>1592-1600</pages><keywords><keyword>UAV</keyword><keyword>network</keyword><keyword>distributed control</keyword><keyword>ALGORITHMS</keyword><keyword>communication delay</keyword><keyword>consensus</keyword><keyword>DIRECTED NETWORK</keyword><keyword>NONLINEAR AGENTS</keyword><keyword>SWITCHING TOPOLOGY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-66540-593-5</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICUAS54217.2022.9836201</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Consensus theory represents a relevant strategy for the control of distributed multi-UAV missions, whose main feature is the local inter-agent communication.

Moreover, since UAV's energy constrained, it will be a good measure to take multiple UAVs to collect data from devices in large areas. In this paper, we investigate multi-UAV collaborative data collection system, where multiple UAVs collect data from two-dimensional distributed devices on flying mode or hovering mode. The objective is to minimize UAVs' total flight time while allowing each device to complete data upload successfully with limited energy. To this end, firstly, a cell partition based on Voronoi diagram is used to allocate the collection areas of each UAV. Then, in each associated area, UAV determines the whole trajectory to serve devices. Lastly, given load requirement of ground devices and energy limitation, the optimal data collection mode of each device is decided to minimize flight time of each UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-UAV data collection scheme can shorten collection task completion time significantly.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2020 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Zhekun</author><author>Zhao, Liangyu</author><author>Shi, Zhongjiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decentralized Multi-UAV Path Planning Based on Two-Layer Coordinative Framework for Formation Rendezvous</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>45695-45708</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Planning</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicle</keyword><keyword>Task analysis</keyword><keyword>Path planning</keyword><keyword>Autonomous aerial vehicles</keyword><keyword>path planning</keyword><keyword>Kinematics</keyword><keyword>Mathematical models</keyword><keyword>COLLISION-AVOIDANCE</keyword><keyword>ALGORITHM</keyword><keyword>TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>collision-free</keyword><keyword>CONSENSUS</keyword><keyword>decentralized coordination</keyword><keyword>Programming</keyword><keyword>sequential convex programming</keyword><keyword>RESILIENT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3170583</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation rendezvous path planning problem is one of the important research topics in multiple UAV (multi-UAV) coordinated path planning. Aiming at solving low computational efficiency and poor scalability of the traditional multi-UAV path planning method, the decentralized multi-UAV path planning method suitable for obstacle environments is proposed. Firstly, the UAV rendezvous path planning problem with constraints such as the kinematics of UAVs and collision-free constraints is modeled as a non-convex optimal control problem. To minimize formation rendezvous time and energy consumption, a two-layer coordinative framework is developed to solve this problem. In the coordination layer, relying only on the information of neighboring UAVs, each UAV in the decentralized communication graph negotiates the desired flight time using a consensus protocol to achieve coordination among UAVs. In the planning layer, the initial non-convex formation rendezvous path planning problem is decoupled into several sub-problems, which can be solved in parallel by path planners distributed on each UAV using sequential convex programming. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results show that this decentralized multi-UAV path planning method can handle the minimum-time rendezvous path planning problem and optimize the energy consumption in flight, and the computing time does not increase significantly with the enlargement of the UAV swarm. This decentralized framework scales well with the number of UAVs and can be applied for future urban flight and supplies delivery tasks.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Hao</author><author>Carrillo, L.

Lacking the effective control and communication algorithms is impeding the development of multi-UAV systems significantly. In this paper, distributed optimal flocking control and network co-design problem has been investigated for networked multi-UAV system in presence of uncertain harsh environment and unknown dynamics First, the mathematical interaction between network imperfections and practical wireless network channel performance has been investigate. Then, a novel co-model has been developed for networked multi-UAV combining effects from physical system and network channel model effectively. Then, adopting neuro dynamics programming (NDP) technique and actor-critic-identifier (ACI) design architecture, a novel online finite horizon optimal flocking control and network co-design has been proposed. The developed algorithm cannot merely obtain the distributed optimal co-design within finite time, but also relax the stringent requirement about physical UAV system and network dynamics In addition, developed novel co-design can satisfy the practical constraints, e.g. transmit power constraint etc. The Lyapunov stability analysis is used to validate the effectiveness of developed scheme. With the proper NN weight update law, proposed co-design can ensure all closed-loop signals and NN weights are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Furthermore, simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Bellingham</custom1><custom3>UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XIX</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Göktogan, A.

A total of ten (10) terminals were structured. Stochastic analysis of the scheme's impact with anticipated estimations of its inherent network variation challenges within the confined spectrum-sharing zone is conducted and mitigated. We then introduced four (4) novel GUEs-BSs terminal communication protocols to orchestrate communication among the deployed component terminals. The four communication protocols are the single-hop (direct), the multihop, the selective-decode-and-forward (SDP), and the incremental-decode-and-forward (IDF) protocol models. The proposed multi-UAV uplink-downlink (UL-DL) model is later deployed into direct-dense and relay-dense network environments to ascertain its robustness.

The primary reason for this increase is that UAVs eliminate the risk to human life in difficult and dangerous missions, are cost effective, and easily are deployed. Developments in UAV technology and decreasing costs have increased UAV usage. However, when multiple UAVs are deployed, inter UAV communication becomes complicated. For this reason, communication in multi-UAV systems is the most important problem that needs to be solved. To enable communication among UAVs without infrastructure support, a Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) is used. A FANET provides UAVs to fly in tandem without colliding. To ensure coordinated flight, UAVs require the location information of other UAVs. In this study, we developed a common channel multi-token circulation protocol to share location information in multi-UAV systems that communicate using a FANET. The proposed method ensures that UAVs in multi-UAV systems know each other's coordinate information with minimum error.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, Le-Mai-Duyen</author><author>Vo, Van Nhan</author><author>So-In, Chakchai</author><author>Dang, Viet-Hung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Throughput analysis and optimization for NOMA Multi-UAV assisted disaster communication using CMA-ES</title><secondary-title>WIRELESS NETWORKS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WIRELESS NETWORKS</full-title><abbr-1>Wirel.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the system performance for the Internet of Things (IoT) using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the disaster area. The communication protocol is separated into two phases: In the first phase, due to the resource limitation, UAV relays (URs) harvest energy from a ground power beacon (GPB) to support the communication process. In the second phase, the ground base station (GBS) sends the signal to the first UR by using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. It is noted that the first UR uses its energy harvested from the first phase to forward the signal to the second UR by applying the decode-and-forward (DF) approach. Similarly, the second UR uses DF to transfer the signal to two IoT sensor node (IoTS) clusters, i.e., near cluster and far cluster. Accordingly, we derive the closed-form expression of the throughput for the IoTSs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) with Nakagami-m fading and formulate a new problem of throughput optimization for multi-UAV system. For optimization problem, solutions are found using covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. The numerical results show that system performance in terms of throughput can be improved by tuning the UAVs' altitudes and distances from the GBS to suitable values.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singhal, Chetna</author><author>Barick, Subhrajit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECMS: Energy-Efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance System for Inaccessible Regions</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>95876-95891</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicle</keyword><keyword>Autonomous aerial vehicles</keyword><keyword>Surveillance</keyword><keyword>Network topology</keyword><keyword>Routing protocols</keyword><keyword>Routing</keyword><keyword>load balancing</keyword><keyword>NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>DRONES</keyword><keyword>COVERAGE</keyword><keyword>Streaming media</keyword><keyword>multi-path routing</keyword><keyword>remote surveillance</keyword><keyword>UAV network topology</keyword><keyword>Load management</keyword><keyword>Multipath channels</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206375</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The evolution and popular adaptation of drone technology in diverse applications has necessitated advancement of UAV communication framework. UAVs inherently support features like mobility, flexibility, adaptive altitude, which make them a preferable option for dynamic surveillance of remote locations. Multiple UAVs can cooperatively work to accomplish surveillance missions more efficiently. However, the intermittent network connectivity and the limited onboard energy storage impose a great challenge on UAV-assisted remote surveillance. This paper presents an Energy-efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance (ECMS) system for surveillance of inaccessible regions. The system employs an optimal Multi-UAV Collaborative Monocular Vision (MCMV) topology to facilitate the surveillance with zero blind spot using minimum number of drones. We also propose an application-aware Multi-Path Weighted Load-balancing (MWL) routing protocol for handling congestion by distributing traffic among all available resources in UAV network and adaptively selecting the of source datarate (i.e. switching video resolution). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed surveillance system achieves coverage with lesser number of UAVs compared to the existing systems. It also achieves higher throughput, higher packet-delivery ratio, higher residual energy of UAVs, and lower end-to-end delay.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fabra, Francisco</author><author>Zamora, Willian</author><author>Reyes, Pablo</author><author>Calafate, Carlos T.</author><author>Cano, Juan-Carlos</author><author>Manzoni, Pietro</author><author>Hernandez-Orallo, Enrique</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An UAV Swarm Coordination Protocol Supporting Planned Missions</title><secondary-title>28th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 28TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>UAV</keyword><keyword>swarm</keyword><keyword>UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES</keyword><keyword>ArduSim</keyword><keyword>flight coordination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72811-856-7</isbn><abstract>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being widely used as a valuable tool in critical situations, especially when the access to the target area is difficult or hazardous. In these situations, a swarm of UAVs can provide additional benefits by covering larger areas, thereby speeding up the fulfillment of a mission, or by carrying heavier loads that a single UAV would not support. In this paper we present MUSCOP, a protocol that allows a set of UAVs to properly synchronize their flight in the fulfillment of planned missions. The results obtained show that MUSCOP achieves a high degree of swarm cohesion even in the presence of channel losses, introducing minimum synchronization delays and low position offset errors compared to an ideal scenario.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2019 28TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bayerlein, Harald</author><author>Theile, Mirco</author><author>Caccamo, Marco</author><author>Gesbert, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-UAV Path Planning for Wireless Data Harvesting With Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><secondary-title>IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Open J.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kumar, Varun K.

Growth in kind of applications resulted in increasing the scope of wireless communication and allocating a spectrum, as well as methods to decrease the intervention between nearby-located wireless links functioning on the same spectrum bands and hence to proliferation for the spectral efficiency. Recent advancement in drone technology has evolved quickly leading on board sensors with increased energy, storage, communication and processing capabilities. In future, the drone sensor networks will be more common and energy utilization will play a crucial role to maintain a fully functional network for the longest period of time. Envisioning the aerial drone network, this study proposes a robust high level design of algorithms for the drones (group coordination). The proposed design is validated with two algorithms using multiple drones consisting of various on-board sensors. In addition, this paper also discusses the challenges involved in designing solutions. The result obtained through proposed method outperforms the traditional techniques with the transfer rate of more than 3 MB for data transfer in the drone with coordination Design/methodology/approach Fair Scheduling Algorithm (FSA) using a queue is a distributed slot assignment algorithm. The FSA executes in rounds. The duration of each round is dynamic based upon the delay in the network. FSA prevents the collision by ensuring that none of the neighboring node gets the same slot. Nodes (Arivudainambi et al., 2019) which are separated by two or more hopes can get assigned in the same slot, thereby preventing the collision. To achieve fairness at the scheduling level, the FSA maintains four different states for each node as IDLE, REQUEST, GRANT and RELEASE. Findings A multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system can operate in both centralized and decentralized manner. In a centralized system, the ground control system will take care of drone data collection, decisions on navigation, task updation, etc. In a decentralized system, the UAVs are unambiguously collaborating on various levels as mentioned in the centralized system to achieve the goal which is represented in Figure 2. Research limitations/implications However, the multi-UAVs are context aware in situations such as environmental observation, UAV-UAV communication and decision-making. Independent of whether operation is centralized or decentralized, this study relates the goals of the multi-UAVs are sensing, communication and coordination among other UAVs, etc. Figure 3 shows overall system architecture. Practical implications The individual events attempts in the UAV's execution are required to complete the mission in superlative manner which affects in every multi UAV system. This multi UAV systems need to take a steady resolute on what way UAV has to travel and what they need to complete to face the critical situations in changing of environments with the uncertain information. This coordination algorithm has certain dimensions including events that they needs to resolute on, the information that they used to make a resolution, the resolute making algorithm, the degree of decentralization. In multi UAV systems, the coordinated events ranges from lower motion level. Originality/value This study has proposed a novel self-organizing coordination algorithm for multi-UAV systems. Further, the experimental results also confirm that is robust to form network at ease. The testbed for this simulation to sensing, communication, evaluation and networking. The algorithm coordination has to testbed with multi UAVs systems. The two scheduling techniques has been used to transfer the packets using done network. The self-organizing algorithm (SOA) with fair scheduling queue outperforms the weighted queue scheduling in the transfer rate with less loss and time lag. The results obtained through from Figure 10 clearly indicates that the fair queue scheduling with SOA have several advantages over weighted fair queue in different parameters.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Calvo, Alvaro</author><author>Silano, Giuseppe</author><author>Capitan, Jesus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mission Planning and Execution in Heterogeneous Teams of Aerial Robots supporting Power Line Inspection Operations</title><secondary-title>International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2022 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (ICUAS)</full-title></periodical><pages>1644-1649</pages><keywords><keyword>Behavior Trees</keyword><keyword>Multi-UAV systems</keyword><keyword>Power line inspection and maintenance</keyword><keyword>Task planning and execution</keyword><keyword>SYSTEMS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-66540-593-5</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICUAS54217.2022.9836234</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A software architecture aimed at coordinating a team of heterogeneous aerial vehicles for inspection and maintenance operations in high-voltage power line scenarios is presented in this paper.

This paper proposes a decentralized UAV swarm persistent monitoring strategy in realizing continuous sensing coverage and network service. A two-layer (high altitude and low altitude) UAV teaming hierarchical structure is adopted in realizing the accurate object tracking in the area of interest (AOI). By introducing the UAV communication channel model in its path planning, both centralized and decentralized control schemes would be evaluated in the waypoint tracking simulation. The UAV swarm network service and object tracking are measured by metrics of communication link quality and waypoints tracking accuracy. UAV swarm network connectivity are evaluated over different aspects, such as stability and volatility. The comparison of proposed algorithms is presented with simulations. The result shows that the decentralized scheme outperforms the centralized scheme in the mission of persistent surveillance, especially on maintaining the stability of inner UAV swarm network while tracking moving objects.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selecky, Martin</author><author>Faigl, Jan</author><author>Rollo, Milan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication Architecture in Mixed-Reality Simulations of Unmanned Systems</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>853</pages><volume>18</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>communication architecture</keyword><keyword>unmanned systems</keyword><keyword>middleware</keyword><keyword>testbeds</keyword><keyword>NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>AD-HOC</keyword><keyword>mixed-reality simulations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>MAR 2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s18030853</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Verification of the correct functionality of multi-vehicle systems in high-fidelity scenarios is required before any deployment of such a complex system, e.g., in missions of remote sensing or in mobile sensor networks. Mixed-reality simulations where both virtual and physical entities can coexist and interact have been shown to be beneficial for development, testing, and verification of such systems. This paper deals with the problems of designing a certain communication subsystem for such highly desirable realistic simulations. Requirements of this communication subsystem, including proper addressing, transparent routing, visibility modeling, or message management, are specified prior to designing an appropriate solution. Then, a suitable architecture of this communication subsystem is proposed together with solutions to the challenges that arise when simultaneous virtual and physical message transmissions occur. The proposed architecture can be utilized as a high-fidelity network simulator for vehicular systems with implicit mobility models that are given by real trajectories of the vehicles. The architecture has been utilized within multiple projects dealing with the development and practical deployment of multi-UAV systems, which support the architecture's viability and advantages. The provided experimental results show the achieved similarity of the communication characteristics of the fully deployed hardware setup to the setup utilizing the proposed mixed-reality architecture.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nagarji, Javedkhan</author><author>Arya, Hemendra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulation of Effects of Perturbations and Different Network Topologies on Swarm Cooperative Missions</title><secondary-title>4th IFAC Conference on Advances in Control and Optimization of Dynamical Systems (ACODS 2016)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IFAC PAPERSONLINE</full-title></periodical><pages>824-829</pages><volume>49</volume><keywords><keyword>consensus protocol</keyword><keyword>cooperative mission</keyword><keyword>effects of perturbations</keyword><keyword>network topologies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.03.160</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The consensus protocol used in swarm cooperative mission for different network topologies is studied in the presence of various perturbations.

Equipped with sensors and cameras, these technologies can perform much on-demand critical application ranging from military and environmental to rescue operations. These UAVs devices, sometimes tiny, that can replace human and manned aircraft in several tasks, have been utilized to perform various types of services and applications more efficiently. However, the deployment side of such emerging technology is still facing many issues and challenges. Using multi-drones or swarm of drones, together to accomplish one operation is one of these recent challenges. Such a system requires a high level of delicacy and cooperation to achieve the required autonomy and reduce human interaction as possible. Communication is one of the biggest challenges in these systems, since the devices should keep exchanging various types of messages with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, a collaborative autonomous system of swarm drones based on deep learning has been proposed and a testbed of cooperative UAVs' mission to validate the performance of the dedicated QoS communication system using Paparazzi drones The proposed system is aware of the drones' requirements in term of QoS and able to meet with their dynamic demands.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>MOBIWAC'19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOBILITY MANAGEMENT AND WIRELESS ACCESS</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Yuman</author><author>Wang, Yingjian</author><author>Zhong, Xingguang</author><author>Yang, Tiankai</author><author>Wang, Mingyang</author><author>Xu, Zhixiong</author><author>Wang, Yongchao</author><author>Lin, Yi</author><author>Xu, Chao</author><author>Gao, Fei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meeting-Merging-Mission: A Multi-robot Coordinate Framework for Large-Scale Communication-Limited Exploration</title><secondary-title>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2022 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)</full-title></periodical><pages>13700-13707</pages><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-66547-927-1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981544</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This letter presents a complete framework Meeting-Merging-Mission for multi-robot exploration under communication restriction. Considering communication is limited in both bandwidth and range in the real world, we propose a lightweight environment presentation method and an efficient cooperative exploration strategy. For lower bandwidth, each robot uses specific polytopes to maintain free space and to generate Super Frontier Information (SFI), which serves as the source for exploration decision-making. To reduce repeated exploration, we develop a mission-based protocol that drives robots to share collected information in stable rendezvous. We also design a complete path planning scheme for both centralized and decentralized cases.

Beyond the limits of single UAV system, multi-UAV systems which can perform complex mission-oriented tasks better have been recently introduced. However, previous systems are less automated in the way that human intervention is still required to execute missions, and they were implemented for the only purpose of carrying out specific scenarios. In this paper, in order to automate the required procedures in the system and increase system flexibility, we propose a control integrated query processing system for coordination of multiple UAVs. We devise a high level query language to express a user command for a variety of UAVs' tasks by integrating the ways of controlling movements and actions of multiple UAVs and collecting data from them. We present the overall architecture of the query processing system and experimental results on testbed using real UAVs.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2017 14TH IEEE ANNUAL CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS &amp; NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Rango, Floriano</author><author>Palmieri, Nunzia</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Karlsen, R.

In this paper is investigated a collective task that requires a multi-robot system to search for randomly distributed mines in an unknown environment and disarm them cooperatively. The communication among the swarm of robots influences the overall performance in terms of time to execute the task or consumed energy. To address this problem, a new distributed recruiting protocol to coordinate a swarm of robots in demining mission, is described. This problem is a multi-objective problem and two bio inspired strategies are used. The novelty of this approach lies in the combination of direct and indirect communication: on one hand an indirect communication among robots is used for the exploration of the environment, on the other hand a novel protocol is used to accomplish the recruiting and coordination of the robots for demining task. This protocol attempts to tackle the question of how autonomous robot can coordinate themselves into an unknown environment relying on simple low-level capabilities. The strategy is able to adapt the current system dynamics if the number of robots or the environment structure or both change. The proposed approach has been implemented and has been evaluated in several simulated environments. We analyzed the impact of our approach in the overall performance of a robot team. Experimental results indicated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed protocol to spread the robots in the environment.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Bellingham</custom1><custom3>UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XVIII</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chriki, Amira</author><author>Touati, Haifa</author><author>Snoussi, Hichem</author><author>Kamoun, Farouk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>UAV-GCS Centralized Data-Oriented Communication Architecture for Crowd Surveillance Applications</title><secondary-title>15th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IEEE IWCMC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 15TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC)</full-title></periodical><pages>2064-2069</pages><keywords><keyword>Centralized architecture</keyword><keyword>Crowd Surveillance Applications</keyword><keyword>Data-Oriented communication</keyword><keyword>Ground Control Station (GCS)</keyword><keyword>QoS management</keyword><keyword>Unmanned Ariel Vehicles(UAV)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-5386-7747-6</isbn><abstract>In recent years, a large number of researchers investigate the conception of systems that use a unique Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAV) or multiple independent UAVs to conduct civil or military missions, with minimal human intervention. In this paper we focus on using multiple UAVs to cooperatively monitor a crowded area. Communication in such UAVs network is an ongoing project. Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result. The class of the data as well as other relevant information about the detected event will be used by the GCS to authorize or not UAV data transmission and hence to optimize the bandwidth usage efficiency.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2019 15TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Lizhi</author><author>Zhao, Xuejiao</author><author>Zhang, Yuan</author><author>Wang, Xiaohong</author><author>Ma, Tielin</author><author>Gao, Xia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm mission reliability modeling and evaluation method oriented to systematic and networked mission</title><secondary-title>CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS</full-title><abbr-1>Chin.

Traditional single-UAV mission reliability modeling methods have been unable to meet the requirements of UAV swarm mission reliability modeling. Therefore, the UAV swarm mission reliability modeling and evaluation method is proposed. First, aimed at the interdependence among the multiple layers, a multi-layer network model of a UAV swarm is established. At the same time, based on the system having the following characteristics?using a mission chain to complete the mission and applying the connectivity of the mission network?the mission network model of a UAV swarm is established. Second, vulnerability and connectivity are selected as two indicators to reflect the reliability of the mission, and aimed at random attack and deliberate attack, vulnerability and connectivity evaluation methods are proposed. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the constructed model are verified through simulations,and the model and selected indicators can meet the reliability requirements of the UAV swarm mis-sion. In this way, this study provides quantitative reference for UAV-swarm-related decision -making work and supports the development of UAV-swarm-related work.

Based on the concept of modularity, the proposed architecture divides the overall system into five layers: 1) low-level control layer; 2) high-level control layer; 3) coordination layer; 4) communication layer; and 5) human interaction layer, and many modules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and outputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can be reduced but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale of 21 fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work which successfully demonstrates formation flight, target recognition, and tracking missions within an integrated architecture for fixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gupta, Lav</author><author>Jain, Raj</author><author>Vaszkun, Gabor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Survey of Important Issues in UAV Communication Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Commun.

These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashwini, K.</author><author>Vijayakumar, M.

As a new form of flying things, they can access the network for better communication via the aerial base station. Most of the Unmanned aerial vehicles assisted flying objects' optimal path selection schemes does not consider the path deviation. In path deviation attacks, secure data transmission are not addressed in existing works. The secure communication process between Unmanned aerial vehicles and base station are exploited through security-based attacks. Moreover, path loss issue leads to multicast packet loss and unsecured broadcast. The existing network architecture setup does not fulfill the secure data communication and privacy issues. In this paper, Blockchain is utilized to investigate the secure communication between Unmanned aerial vehicles to Wireless Unmanned aerial vehicles Base stations. Since the destination information is dynamic under an uncertain environment, it will cause a delay in data communication. Unmanned aerial vehicles are more vulnerable to security attacks. The proposed blockchain-based architecture supports secure data communication in Unmanned aerial vehicles uncertain environments. To improve network security, this paper designs a modified particle swarm optimization method for better path selection. Through these experimental results, a blockchain-based data communication scheme is outer performed concerning network security.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mehiar, Duaa Abdel Fattah</author><author>Azizul, Zati Hakim</author><author>Kiong, Loo Chu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>REDUCING INTERRUPTS AMONG ROBOTS IN QUANTUM-BEHAVED SWARM EXPLORATION WITH MR-LEACH</title><secondary-title>MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</full-title><abbr-1>Malayas.

This paper examines the Multi-hop Routing with Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (MR-LEACH) to improve the inter-connectivity in the QRDPSO. The MR-LEACH identifies partitions in the network into multi-hop network paths. The multi-hop network paths allow all robots to exchange information without unnecessarily restricting the swarm's range explicitly. As a result, the QRDPSO with MR LEACH shows seamless inter-connectivity among the robots, lowering power consumption and increasing robots' lifetime. Interestingly, this paper also shows that the QRDPSO can reach a faster optimal solution when adopting other communication protocols such as the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) communication schema. However, swarm endurance and reduced robot loss are considered vital resources over convergence speed for a swarm robot exploration in unstructured scenarios, such as search and rescue missions.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Peng</author><author>Fu, Wenwen</author><author>You, Hongjun</author><author>Liu, Yuxi</author><author>Wu, Zhihao</author><author>Qu, Ran</author><author>Li, Yahui</author><author>Zhang, Kailong</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Zhang, K.</author><author>Chen, Q.</author><author>Zheng, J.</author><author>Xu, S.</author><author>Zhang, R.</author><author>Du, W.</author><author>Li, S.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-level Modeling and Cooperation Mechanisms of Tasks for Swarm Intelligent Systems</title><secondary-title>IEEE/ACIS 21st International Fall Virtual Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS Fall)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2021 IEEE/ACIS 21ST INTERNATIONAL FALL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (ICIS 2021-FALL)</full-title></periodical><pages>9-13</pages><keywords><keyword>Mission</keyword><keyword>Event-triggered</keyword><keyword>DDS</keyword><keyword>Hierarchical Task Models</keyword><keyword>Parsing</keyword><keyword>Swarm Intelligent Systems</keyword><keyword>Autonomous Cooperation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72817-679-6</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICISFALL51598.2021.9627407</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cooperation is an obvious intelligence feature for Swarm Intelligent Systems (SIS), and where, autonomous task cooperation is one of the core issues for such systems that run in complicated environments, such as factories and aerospace. Focusing on this topic, the mechanisms for modeling and coordinating tasks are deeply studied in this article. After analyzing typical features of task cooperation, a hierarchical architecture of task models is firstly proposed and established, where mission, sub-mission and atom task models are designed, from the top-level to the bottom. Meanwhile, a policy-based parsing mechanism is proposed to autonomously decompose a mission into a set of atom tasks with special constraints. On this basis, resource related entities for various atom tasks are designed uniformly, and for the purpose of behavior synchronization, the concept of virtual logic task is further introduced and Topic-based communication channel is adopted over DDS middleware. Finally, a typical example is given and analyzed.

With this rapid growth, studies using UAVs are underway in various areas. UAVs are more economical and effective when utilizing several nodes rather than operating a single aircraft. In general, UAVs collect and transmit information to the control center (CC), and act on control commands from the CC. Communication between UAVs and the control center is usually achieved using modules such as radio frequency (RF), Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and cellular. However, when multiple UAVs communicate directly with the CC, the limitations of communication technologies and problems with increasing nodes occur. To address these points, several studies have constructed an ad-hoc network of UAVs to address the limitations of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication range, or the high cost of cellular systems. However, previous studies have constructed fixed topology ad-hoc networks. These studies did not take into account the problem of changing network topology due to the rapid mobility and frequent formation changes of UAVs. Due to this, limits occurred such that UAVs moved only in the pre-built topology. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topology construction protocol for UAV swarms to address this problem. The main contents of this paper are as follows. We first look at the research and limitations of existing UAV communications, and propose a protocol to solve this problem. This paper proposes a protocol for UAV construction of ad-hoc networks when trying to perform missions using multiple UAVs, and also describes how the changed network topology is reconstructed when network topology changes due to changes in flight formation. Finally, we establish a situation and apply the proposed protocol, analyze the results and describe further required research.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Kyusuk</author><author>Al Nuaimi, Eiman</author><author>Al Blooshi, Shamma</author><author>Psiakis, Rafail</author><author>Yeun, Chan Yeob</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Su, C.</author><author>Gritzalis, D.</author><author>Piuri, V.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A New Scalable Mutual Authentication in Fog-Edge Drone Swarm Environment</title><secondary-title>17th International Conference on Information Security Practice and Experience (ISPEC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INFORMATION SECURITY PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE, ISPEC 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>179-196</pages><volume>13620</volume><keywords><keyword>UAV</keyword><keyword>Authentication</keyword><keyword>PROTOCOL</keyword><keyword>Drone Swarm</keyword><keyword>Fog-Edge</keyword><keyword>PUF</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer International Publishing Ag</publisher><isbn>978-3-031-21279-6 978-3-031-21280-2</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-031-21280-2_10</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A drone swarm is a preferable way in deploying drones for large-scale missions. In establishing drone swarms, secure communication between a fog drone and several edge drones is essential to mutually authenticate each other. Although many research works proposed the designs of mutual authentications, none of them meets the adequate security for the drone swarm environments, requiring either involvement of the ground station during the authentication process or expensive PKI-based crypto operations. Only a few works proposed more lightweight authentication, however, they are still vulnerable to key compromises in addition to the limited flexibility and scalability. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable authentication protocol for fog-edge drone swarm environments, enabling mutual authentication between fog and edges without involving the ground station. We also show the design can leverage various hardware-assisted security functions. Protocol evaluations show security requirements satisfaction while achieving 14-20 times less computation overhead as compared to PKI-based models.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Cham</custom1><custom3>INFORMATION SECURITY PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE, ISPEC 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Touati, Haifa</author><author>Chriki, Amira</author><author>Snoussi, Hichem</author><author>Kamoun, Farouk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive Radio and Dynamic TDMA for efficient UAVs swarm communications</title><secondary-title>COMPUTER NETWORKS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>COMPUTER NETWORKS</full-title><abbr-1>Comput.

Multiple UAVs can cooperatively carry out dangerous applications for human operators or missions where human intervention is not needed, such as surveillance and monitoring of areas of interest and physical infrastructures. Due to the lack of proper communication rules and standards, communication remains one of the most crucial design issues for UAVs swarm. Furthermore, UAVs generally operate in frequency bands shared with other users. Hence, these spectral bands become overcrowded and UAVs may face a spectrum scarcity issue. To address the above challenges, it is essential to define a reliable communication architecture for multiple UAVs coordination and efficient bandwidth sharing. A promising technology that can satisfy the spectrum requirements of the emerging UAVs Networks is Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). The goal is to opportunistically use spectral bands with minimum interference to other users or applications, i.e., primary users. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum scarcity encountered by UAVs. We present a centralized CRN-based communication approach for UAVs-Ground Control Station (GCS) communication. The GCS is used as a central coordinator to handle bandwidth usage for the UAVs swarm in its coverage zone. It selects, allocates, and shares available frequencies using CRN and Software Defined Radio (SDR). To share the available CRN-frequency between the different UAVs in its scope, the GCS uses dynamic Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique. The performance of the proposed communication approach is evaluated in a surveillance context in terms of the total time required to transfer UAVs data, the total number of packets sent, and the achieved throughput.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbier, Magali</author><author>Bensana, Eric</author><author>Pucel, Xavier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A generic and modular architecture for maritime autonomous vehicles</title><secondary-title>IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Workshop (AUV)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2018 IEEE/OES AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE WORKSHOP (AUV)</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Software architecture</keyword><keyword>Autonomous robots</keyword><keyword>Maritime scenarios</keyword><keyword>Mission online adaptation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72810-253-5</isbn><abstract>Autonomous systems face the challenge of managing disruptive events such as internal alterations, mission updates and environmental perturbations that always occur in an operational context.

The emergent improvements of a swarm-based system depend on the selected architecture and the appropriate assignments of the system parameters. To have an improved system, swarm characteristics such as agents/individuals, groups/clusters and communication/interactions should be appropriately characterized according to the system mission. Simulation is one of the best processes to monitor the efficiency of each systems' functionality before its real implementation. Because of the novel and special nature of swarm-based systems, a clear roadmap toward swarm simulation is needed and the process of assigning and evaluating the important parameters should be introduced. This paper in going to determine the important swarm characteristics in simulation phase and explain evaluation methods for important swarm parameters. It also introduces simulation methods of the swarm sub-systems in an artificial world. To clarify the proposed strategies, the AntNet routing algorithm simulation and performance evaluation process is studied according to the proposed methods.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Athens</custom1><custom3>ACMOS '08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, MODELLING AND SIMULATION</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jamshidi, Vahid</author><author>Nekoukar, Vahab</author><author>Refan, Mohammad Hossein</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of Parallel Genetic Algorithm and Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm UAV Path Planning on Controller Area Network</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Evolutionary algorithms are a conventional method to solve complex optimization problems with multiple constraints. However, they are time-consuming algorithms which make their implementation difficult. UAV path planning is usually a real-time problem that is needed to solve in limited time steps. Parallelization is one of the most effective methods for reducing the computation time of evolutionary algorithms. In the industrial applications, usually there is a communication platform between devices which can be used for the implementation of the parallelization process. For example, controller area network (CAN) is a protocol used for reliable communication in aerospace systems. Due to the development of this protocol on UAVs and its characteristics, it can be used for parallel optimization of path planning problem. In this paper, an asynchronous distributed multi-master parallel genetic algorithm and a parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm are implemented on CAN bus to improve the speed and performance of the UAV path planning.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Toorchi, Niloofar</author><author>Hu, Fei</author><author>Bentley, Elizabeth Serena</author><author>Kumar, Sunil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Skeleton-Based Swarm Routing (SSR): Intelligent Smooth Routing for Dynamic UAV Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1286-1303</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Geometric routing</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>stochastic dynamic programming</keyword><keyword>swarm networks</keyword><keyword>UAV communication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043672</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires the transmission of mission-related data across the network. The resource constraints and dynamic nature of the swarm bring critical challenges to the design of UAV routing protocols. Most of the conventional ad hoc routing schemes are not intelligent and cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of UAV swarming networks. On the other hand, some artificial intelligence (AI)-based routing schemes may consume significant computational resources in the UAVs. In this article, a low-cost, adaptive routing protocol, namely skeleton-based swarm routing (SSR), is proposed, which exploits an intelligent online learning algorithm and the topology features of the mission-driven UAV swarm to distribute the traffic over optimal routes. Here, the skeleton represents the most stable parts of the swarm formation. SSR architecture consists of three modules: 1) A geometric addressing module, which assigns geometric coordinates to each node based on the swarm skeleton structure; 2) A leaf-like routing pipe which allows the selection of multiple candidate routes around the shortest path; 3) An intelligent low-complexity learning model which determines how to distribute the packets inside the routing pipe to achieve load-balanced, high-throughput transmissions. The proposed skeleton-based scheme can also facilitate the UAV formation construction and morphing. The simulation results show that the proposed SSR protocol can noticeably improve the network performance (up to 100% throughput improvement) compared to the single path routing schemes, such as the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and link-quality and traffic-load aware optimized link state routing (LTA-OLSR) protocols.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheriguene, Youssra</author><author>Djellikh, Soumia</author><author>Bousbaa, Fatima Zohra</author><author>Lagraa, Nasreddine</author><author>Lakas, Abderrahmane</author><author>Kerrache, Chaker Abdelaziz</author><author>Tahari, Abdou El Karim</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Maga, D.</author><author>Hajek, J.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>SEMRP: an Energy-efficient Multicast Routing Protocol for UAV Swarms</title><secondary-title>IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE/ACM 24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION AND REAL TIME APPLICATIONS (DS-RT)</full-title></periodical><pages>182-189</pages><keywords><keyword>UAVs</keyword><keyword>Multicast Routing Protocol</keyword><keyword>SEMRP</keyword><keyword>Swarm of UAVs</keyword><keyword>AD HOC NETWORKS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72817-343-6</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ds-rt50469.2020.9213700</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The deployment of a swarm of cooperative UAVs applications for the execution of distributed tasks has increased attention from both academia and industry researchers. The use of a group of UAVs instead of one single UAV offers many advantages like extending the mission coverage, providing a reliable ad-hoc networks services, and enhancing the service performance, to name a few. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of the swarm topology, the coordination of a large number of UAVs poses new challenges to traditional inter-UAV communication protocols. Therefore, there is a need for the design of new networking protocols that can efficiently support the fast-pace and real-time requirements of a coordinated swarm navigation in various environments. In this paper, we propose SEMRP a Swarm energy-efficient multicast routing protocol for UAVs flying in group formations. The main purpose of SEMRP is to facilitate the control and information delivery between UAVs while minimizing inter-UAV packet loss, packet re-transmission, and end-to-end delay. In this study we show how SEMRP achieves these objectives by taking into account various Quality-of-Service parameters like the network throughput, the UAVs mobility, and energy efficiency to ensure a timely and accurate information delivery to all members of a UAV swarm. The results of the conducted simulation using NS-2 advocate for the efficiency of our proposal through its to two presented versions (SEMRP-v1 and SEMRP-v2) in term of reducing the total emission energy (at least by 10 dBm), optimizing the End-to-End Delay by 44%, and increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE/ACM 24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION AND REAL TIME APPLICATIONS (DS-RT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qin, Boyu</author><author>Zhang, Dong</author><author>Tang, Shuo</author><author>Wang, Mengyang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distributed Grouping Cooperative Dynamic Task Assignment Method of UAV Swarm</title><secondary-title>APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL</full-title><abbr-1>Appl.

The dynamic task assignment model for the UAV swarm with the topology of distributed subsets is established considering multiple constraints such as task cooperation, performing sequence, dynamic environment, communication topology, payload model, and UAV capability. According to the characteristics of multi-participants and multi-tasks in the process of UAV swarm executing tasks, the determination mechanism on cooperators and the selection mechanism of sequential tasks are proposed, and then the contract network protocol is extended. On the basis of the above, an event-triggered task assignment strategy for dynamic tasks is designed. The simulated results show that the proposed method can achieve the cooperative dynamic assignment of the UAV swarm to perform reconnaissance-and-attack tasks to multi-targets in complex and uncertain combat scenarios, improve the adaptiveness of the swarm under the sudden circumstance, and realize the optimization for task execution efficiency of the UAV swarm.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Misra, Sudip</author><author>Deb, Pallav Kumar</author><author>Saini, Kartik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic Leader Selection in a Master-Slave Architecture-Based Micro UAV Swarm</title><secondary-title>IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2021 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Internet of Things</keyword><keyword>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</keyword><keyword>Dynamic leader selection</keyword><keyword>Greedy heuristic solution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72818-104-2</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685538</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper, we present a method for dynamically selecting leaders in a master-slave communication model in a swarm of micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). With the growing size of the UAV swarm in complex missions, it becomes a challenge to control them for efficient execution of missions. In a traditional centralized communication model where all UAVs in the swarm are controlled directly through ground control, channel capacity limits the number of UAVs in the swarm which restricts the scalability. In the context of low-power miniature drones, we limit the communication of the ground Base Station (gBS) with only one UAV (leader) which controls the rest of the UAVs (followers). Towards this, we propose a greedy heuristic method for selecting the UAV leader that requires minimal time to communicate with the gBS in real-time. The proposed master-slave model enhances the scalability of the swarm by improving the utilization of channel resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic leader selection enhances the lifetime of the entire network with a multifold decrease in energy consumption, compared to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the lifetime of the network also decreases on operating with a single UAV leader. We also observe reductions in delays by almost 60% and an increase in data rate by 50%.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2021 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Ning</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Urban Rail Transit Network Planning Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm</title><secondary-title>MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING</full-title><abbr-1>Math.

The learning factor is dynamically adjusted according to the inertia weight parameters, and the particle swarm optimization parameters are selected in combination with the setting of the maximum velocity parameters. The individual optimal particle is selected by using the dominant relationship between the individual particles, and the optimization of the optimal particle is completed by combining the selection requirements of the global optimal particle. We design the v2x communication implementation scheme, obtain the traffic flow information of urban rail transit, build the signal input and output model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm, obtain the output feedback signal, and determine the planning scale of urban rail transit network, so as to build the urban rail transit network planning model and complete the urban rail transit network planning.

In the event of fire, mine collapse or disasters like earthquake, swarm of robots can enter the area, conduct rescue operations, collect images and convey locations of interest to the rescue team and enable them to plan their approach in advance. Task allocation among members of the swarm is a critical and challenging problem to be addressed. DTTA-a distributed, Time-division multiple access (TDMA) based task allocation framework is proposed for swarm of robots which can be utilised to solve any of the 8 different types of task allocation problem identified by Gerkey and Mataric'. DTTA is reactive and supports task migration via extended task assignments to complete the mission in case of failure of the assigned robot to complete the task. DTTA can be utilised for any kind of robot in land or for co-operative systems comprising of land robots and air-borne drones. Dependencies with other layers of the protocol stack were identified and a quantitative analysis of communication and computational complexity is provided. To our knowledge this is the first work to be reported on task allocation for clustered scalable networks suitable for handling all 8 types of multi-robot task allocation problem. Effectiveness and feasibility of deploying DTTA in real world scenarios is demonstrated by testing the framework for two diverse application scenarios.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jia, Gaowei</author><author>Hou, Zhongxi</author><author>Wang, Jianfeng</author><author>Liang, Zhitao</author><author>Chen, Qingyang</author><author>Lu, Yafei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The application architecture design of heterogeneous UAV team and its realization</title><secondary-title>Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2020 CHINESE AUTOMATION CONGRESS (CAC 2020)</full-title></periodical><pages>974-980</pages><keywords><keyword>task planning</keyword><keyword>application architecture</keyword><keyword>communication structure</keyword><keyword>experimental test</keyword><keyword>heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72817-687-1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9327340</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control technology expanded the application of UAV team and swarms.

However, being a technology in development, the security and vulnerability of the swarm of robots against possible cybernetic attacks have been commonly overlooked. This is of major concern when executing mission-critical activities that inherently require an adequate management of security. In this work, a bio-inspired security mechanism applied to a swarm of robots is proposed. Through computer simulations, it is observed how the mechanism, when executing a homing towards a stationary landmark, allows the swarm of robots to identify abnormal behaviors, caused by a certain cyberattack; subsequently, it establishes a certain tolerance to it and allows to improve the level of availability that is required to continue executing the task at hand.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Cham</custom1><custom3>ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, MICAI 2018, PT II</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lakew, Demeke Shumeye</author><author>Sa'ad, Umar</author><author>Nhu-Ngoc, Dao</author><author>Na, Woongsoo</author><author>Cho, Sungrae</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Routing in Flying Ad Hoc Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title><secondary-title>IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Commun.

Multi-UAV systems organized in an ad hoc fashion called a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can cooperatively and collaboratively accomplish complex missions more efficiently compared to single large UAV systems. However, the unique features of FANETs such as high mobility, low node density, and high frequency of topology changes introduce challenges to the communication design, especially routing. Thus, the routing requirements of FANETs surpass those of MANETs or VANETs. In this paper, we present UAV classification, communication and application architectures, and an exhaustive survey of the existing routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks. Furthermore, we highlight the key features, strengths and weaknesses, and different mobility models used for the performance evaluation of the existing FANET routing protocols. More importantly, a proposed taxonomy and a review on the existing FANET routing protocols are presented. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges and open research issues.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ribeiro, Laura Michaella Batista</author><author>Muller, Ivan</author><author>Buss Becker, Leandro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication Interface Manager for Improving Performance of Heterogeneous UAV Networks</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>4255</pages><volume>21</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>UAV</keyword><keyword>mobility</keyword><keyword>wireless networks</keyword><keyword>FANETS</keyword><keyword>SYSTEMS</keyword><keyword>ARCHITECTURE</keyword><keyword>802.11P</keyword><keyword>connection stability</keyword><keyword>IEEE standards</keyword><keyword>message reliability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>JUL 2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s21134255</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Exchanging messages with stable connections in missions composed of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) remains a challenge. The variations in UAV distances from each other, considering their individual trajectories, and the medium dynamic factors are important points to be addressed.In this context, to increase the stability of UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication with link quality, this paper presents an interface manager (IM) that is capable of improving communication in multi-UAV networks.Given a predefined set of available individual wireless interfaces, the proposed IM dynamically defines the best interface for sending messages based on on-flight conditions sensed and calculated dynamically from the wireless medium. Different simulation scenarios are generated using a complex and realistic experimental setup composed of traditional simulators such as NS-3, Gazebo, and GzUAV. IEEE 802.11n 2.4 GHz and 802.11p 5 GHz interfaces are used for the IM selection. The IM performance is evaluated in terms of metrics from the medium-access-control (MAC) and physical layers, which aim to improve and maintain the connectivity between the UAVs during the mission, and from the application layer, which targets the reliability in the delivery of messages. The obtained results show that compared with the cases where a single interface is used, the proposed IM is able to increase the network throughput and presents the best proportion of transmitted and received packets, reception power (-60 dBm to -75 dBm), and loss (-80 dB to -85 dB), resulting in a more efficient and stable network connections.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vlasceanu, Emilian</author><author>Popescu, Dan</author><author>Ichim, Loretta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aerial Robotic Team for Complex Monitoring in Precision Agriculture</title><secondary-title>15th Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (DCOSS)</full-title></periodical><pages>167-169</pages><keywords><keyword>precision agriculture</keyword><keyword>internet of things</keyword><keyword>ground control station</keyword><keyword>ground data terminal</keyword><keyword>unmanned aerial system</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72810-570-3</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/DCOSS.2019.00044</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The paper presents an unmanned aerial system (UAS), based on multi-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) architecture, integrated in Internet, able to collect data from ground wireless sensor networks (WSNs), deployed on large areas for prevention agriculture.

The new developments extend the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's CARACaS (Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing) autonomy architecture, which provides foundational software infrastructure, core executive functions, and several default robotic technology modules. In Swarm II, CARACaS demonstrated higher levels of autonomy and more complex cooperation than previous on-water exercises, using full-sized vehicles and real-world sensing and communication. The core autonomous behaviors to support the harbor patrol scenario included Patrol, Track, Inspect, and Trail, providing the capability of finding all vessels entering the patrol area, keeping track of them, inspecting them to infer intent, and trailing suspect vessels. Significantly, CARACaS assumed responsibility for not only executing tasks safely and efficiently but also recognizing what tasks needed to be accomplished, given the current state of the world. Since the heterogeneous USV teams shared world model that evolved, such as due to (dis)appearance of vessels in the area or a change in health or availability of a USV, CARACaS replanned to generate and reallocate the new task list. Thus, human intervention was never required in the loop to task USVs during mission execution, though a supervisory role was supported in the autonomy system for mission monitoring and exception handling. Finally, CARACaS also ensured the USVs avoided hazards and obeyed the applicable rules of the road, using its local motion planning modules.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Bellingham</custom1><custom3>UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XIX</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Si-wei</author><author>Chen, Jing</author><author>Shen, Lin-Cheng</author><author>Tao, Yi</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Xu, H.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>ECNP-based method of distributed dynamic task allocation for multiple observation satellite planning</title><secondary-title>2nd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computer Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTER CONTROL (ICACC 2010), VOL. 4</full-title></periodical><pages>325-328</pages><keywords><keyword>swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>AGENTS</keyword><keyword>acquaintance's trusts</keyword><keyword>extended contract net protocol</keyword><keyword>mixed Multi-Attribute decision</keyword><keyword>multi-satellite planning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-5847-9</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICACC.2010.5486945</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A extended contract net protocol(ECNP) is introduced to solve the dynamic task allocation for multiple satellites collaborative planning system(MSCPS) in which the environment and capabilities of each Agent can dynamically change with time.

Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Changsun</author><author>Lee, Meonghun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Swarm-Intelligence-Centric Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5164</pages><volume>20</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>wireless sensor networks</keyword><keyword>swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>AODV</keyword><keyword>ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>routing algorithm</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>SEP 2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s20185164</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The swarm intelligence (SI)-based bio-inspired algorithm demonstrates features of heterogeneous individual agents, such as stability, scalability, and adaptability, in distributed and autonomous environments. The said algorithm will be applied to the communication network environment to overcome the limitations of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Herein, the swarm-intelligence-centric routing algorithm (SICROA) is presented for use in WSNs that aim to leverage the advantages of the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The proposed routing protocol addresses the problems of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and improves routing performance via collision avoidance, link-quality prediction, and maintenance methods. The proposed method was found to improve network performance by replacing the periodic "Hello" message with an interrupt that facilitates the prediction and detection of link disconnections. Consequently, the overall network performance can be further improved by prescribing appropriate procedures for processing each control message. Therefore, it is inferred that the proposed SI-based approach provides an optimal solution to problems encountered in a complex environment, while operating in a distributed manner and adhering to simple rules of behavior.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shah, A.

Multi-UAV systems structured in an ad hoc manner called UAVs ad hoc network which is also familiar as flying ad hoc Network (FANET). For FANETs, the IEEE 802.11 standard offers Medium Access Control (MAC) layer requirements. Optimization of the contention window (CW) size will optimize the output. Three distinct meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are used in this paper to improve the efficiency of FANETs, which are the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CUCO), the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) \ and the Honey Bee Algorithm (HBA). Optimum CW size is defined through meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Performance comparison among CUCO, DEA, HBA, and traditional MAC based on IEEE 802.11 is presented. Relationships among parameters are obtained through Markov chain based analytical study. Performance metrics such as successful transmission probability, collision probability, channel busy probability, throughput, packet dropping rate (PDR), and delay expressions are derived. Simulation results reveal that meta-heuristic optimization algorithms improve the quality and reliability of communication by increasing throughput and decreasing PDR and latency.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rewadkar, Deepak</author><author>Doye, Dharmpal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FGWSO-TAR: Fractional glowworm swarm optimization for traffic aware routing in urban VANET</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

However, the performance of the VANET depends on the routing protocol in accord with the delay and throughput requirements. Many of the routing protocols have been extensively studied in the literature. Although there are exemptions, they escalate research challenges in traffic aware routing (TAR) protocol of VANET. This paper introduces the fractional glowworm swarm optimization (FGWSO) for the TAR protocol of VANET in an urban scenario that can identify the optimal path for the vehicle with less traffic density and delay time. The proposed FGWSO searches the optimal routing path based on the fitness function formulated in this paper. Fractional glowworm swarm optimization is the combination of the GWSO and fractional theory. Moreover, exponential weighted moving average is utilized to predict the traffic density and the speed of the vehicle, which is utilized as the major constraints in the fitness function of the optimization algorithm to find the optimal traffic aware path. Simulation of FGWSO shows the significant improvement with a minimal end-to-end delay of 6.6395seconds and distance of 17.3962m, respectively, in comparison with the other existing routing approaches. The simulation also validates the optimality of the proposed TAR protocol.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lopez, Martin Andreoni</author><author>Baddeley, Michael</author><author>Lunardi, Willian T.</author><author>Pandey, Anshul</author><author>Giacalone, Jean-Pierre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards Secure Wireless Mesh Networks for UAV Swarm Connectivity: Current Threats, Research, and Opportunities</title><secondary-title>17th Annual IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (IEEE DCOSS)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>17TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (DCOSS 2021)</full-title></periodical><pages>319-326</pages><keywords><keyword>Security</keyword><keyword>UAVs</keyword><keyword>Swarm</keyword><keyword>Mesh Networks</keyword><keyword>AUTHENTICATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Soc</publisher><isbn>978-1-66543-929-9</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/DCOSS52077.2021.00059</electronic-resource-num><abstract>UAVs are increasingly appearing in swarms or formations to leverage cooperative behavior, forming flying ad hoc networks. These UAV-enabled networks can meet several complex mission requirements and are seen as a potential enabler for many of the emerging use-cases in future communication networks. Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and mobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which can cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks are envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their own challenges and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we analyze the key security and resilience issues resulting from the application of wireless mesh networks within UAV swarms. Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of applying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose existing vulnerabilities across the communication stack. Based on this analysis, we present a security-focused architecture for UAV mesh communications. Finally, from the identification of these vulnerabilities, we discuss research opportunities posed by the unique challenges of UAV swarm connectivity.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Los Alamitos</custom1><custom3>17TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (DCOSS 2021)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diller, Jonathan</author><author>Hall, Peter</author><author>Schanker, Corey</author><author>Ung, Kristen</author><author>Belous, Philip</author><author>Russell, Peter</author><author>Han, Qi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title><style face="italic">ICCSwarm:</style><style face="normal"> A Framework for Integrated Communication and Control in UAV Swarms</style></title><secondary-title>8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications (DroNet) Part of MobiSys Conference</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2022 EIGHTH WORKSHOP ON MICRO AERIAL VEHICLE NETWORKS, SYSTEMS, AND APPLICATIONS, DRONET 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>1-6</pages><keywords><keyword>UAV swarm</keyword><keyword>autonomous UAVs</keyword><keyword>UAV data collection</keyword><keyword>UAV networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Assoc Computing Machinery</publisher><isbn>978-1-4503-9405-5</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/3539493.3539579</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have many applications including search and rescue, disaster response, surveillance, infrastructure inspection, among many others. A key aspect of UAV swarms is keeping the UAVs connected through wireless communication and any deployment of UAV swarms must consider communication constraints during motion planning. In this paper we introduce ICCSwarm, a framework for integrating communication and control in UAV swarms. ICCSwarm consists of two phases, a planning phase where combined communication and motion planning are validated in simulation, and a deployment phase, where a UAV architecture designed around integrated communication and control executes missions from the planning phase on physical UAVs. We implemented ICCSwarm on a physical UAV testbed and evaluated its effectiveness through a unique case study in partnership with NASA's JPL.

Applications such as signal tracking or dynamic object tracking with multiple UAVs allow a cost-effective and minimum-risk alternative to missions which have been historically handled with manned aircraft. As such, for these specific applications, we have developed a micro-avionics architecture structured around an in-house customized open-source autopilot and an indigenous Linux based single board payload/flight management computer. The essential 5-km range telemetry and control link radio is backed up by high-power long-range IEEE 802.11n (WiFi) radio device. The redundancy of communication not only improves the reliability of the avionics architecture, but also enables the trade-off between bandwidth and power efficiency. The architecture is capable of transmitting data at rates above 200 kbps up to 4 km away from its ground station equipped with the developed miniature patch antenna tracker. The payload/flight management computer is ready to run a CSI/USB connected daylight or low-illumination infra-red camera, a USB connected software defined radio and different types of sensor payloads such as radar/lidar range sensors and RGBD cameras. Tied to this architecture, we have designed a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing system with MAVlink communication protocol interlinking hardware to Matlab based UAV dynamic models and tracking algorithms. This system allows comprehensive simulation and testing of designed control and guidance algorithms before flight tests while minimizing cost and crash risk. We have successfully used the avionics architecture in flight tests that involve (a) system identification of flight vehicles and (b) tracking and identification of signal sources using multiple UAVs.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2021 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING (ICMAE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Si-wei</author><author>Chen, Jing</author><author>Shen, Lin-Cheng</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Mahadevan, V.</author><author>Jianhong, Z.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A MAS-based negotiation model and its application to multiple observation collaborative satellite planning</title><secondary-title>2nd International Conference on Computer and Automation Engineering (ICCAE)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2010 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERING (ICCAE 2010), VOL 3</full-title></periodical><pages>205-208</pages><keywords><keyword>extended contract net protocol</keyword><keyword>mixed Multi-Attribute decision</keyword><keyword>dynamic task allocation</keyword><keyword>MAS-based negotiation</keyword><keyword>multi-satellite collaborative planning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-5569-0</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5452066</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A multiple agent system(MAS) architecture is constructed for multiple satellites collaborative planning system(MSCPS).

The proposed algorithm exploits the advantages of the ultraviolet scattering communication to maximize the air operation time of the UAV and the efficiency of mission completion. The proposed algorithm improves the threshold of the candidate cluster head selection of non-uniform clustering algorithm by introducing distance and energy. In the inter-cluster communication process, cluster head nodes can select the optimum data transmission route to forward the information to the lead UAV. Compared to LEACH and EEUC, the simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm increases the energy efficiency of the UAV network by 21.02% and 3.92%, respectively. Moreover, the lifetime of the network is extended by 23.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can efficiently balance the energy consumption of the nodes and extend the lifetime of the UAV swarms.</abstract><language>Chinese</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Xiaoping</author><author>Dong, Honghui</author><author>Tang, Junqing</author><author>Jia, Limin</author><author>Qin, Yong</author><author>Cheng, Ruijun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two-Layer Hierarchy Optimization Model for Communication Protocol in Railway Wireless Monitoring Networks</title><secondary-title>WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING</full-title><abbr-1>Wirel.

Hence, how to optimize the communication protocol and extend the system lifetime is crucial to ensure the stability of system. However, the existing studies focused primarily on cluster-based or multihop protocols individually, which are ineffective in coping with the complex communication scenarios in the railway wireless monitoring system (RWMS). This study proposes a hybrid protocol which combines the cluster-based and multihop protocols (CMCP) to minimize and balance the energy consumption in different sections of the RWMS. In the first hierarchy, the total energy consumption is minimized by optimizing the cluster quantities in the cluster-based protocol and the number of hops and the corresponding hop distances in the multihop protocol. In the second hierarchy, the energy consumption is balanced through rotating the cluster head (CH) in the subnetworks and further optimizing the hops and the corresponding hop distances in the backbone network. On this basis, the system lifetime is maximized with the minimum and balance energy consumption among the sensors. Furthermore, the hybrid particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm(PSOGA) are adopted to optimize the energy consumption from the two-layer hierarchy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CMCP is verified in the simulation. The performances of the proposed CMCP in system lifetime, residual energy, and the corresponding variance are all superior to the LEACH protocol widely applied in the previous research. The effective protocol proposed in this study can facilitate the application of the wireless monitoring network in the railway system and enhance safety operation of the railway.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baig, Tanveer Z.</author><author>Shastry, Chandrasekar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SMART HYBRIDIZED ROUTING PROTOCOL FOR ANIMAL MONITORING AND TRACKING APPLICATIONS</title><secondary-title>SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE</full-title><abbr-1>Scalable Comput.-Pract.

As a result, WSNs have been implemented to monitor animal care and track their health status. However, excessive energy utilization and communication traffic on packet transmissions lead to system deterioration, especially whenever perceived information captured in the monitoring area is transferred to the access point over multiple dynamic sinks. Further to manage the energy and data transmission issue, the energy consumption and location aware routing protocol has been architected on the wireless Nano sensor nodes. In this article, a novel hybrid energy and location aware routing protocol to cloud enabled IoT based Wireless Sensor Network towards animal health monitoring and tracking has been proposed. However proposed data routing protocol incorporates the trace file for path selection for data transmission to base station using sink node. Trace file has been obtained on processing the cluster heads established in the network. Therefore, clustering of node in the network has to be achieved using LEACH protocol which enhances the network scalability and network lifetime by clustering the nodes with Metaheuristics constraints like location or node density comparability. The objective of the proposed model is to enhance the network scalability and energy consumption by establishing the multiple node clusters with high density cluster head through Metaheuristics Node Clustering optimization techniques. Metaheuristics based node clustering is been obtained using Improved Particle Swarm Optimization. Further it is employed to compute the optimal path for sensed data transmission to base station. Node clustering provides high energy consumption among the sensing nodes and to establish the high energy clusters towards sensed information dissemination to base station on dynamically reforming the nodes clusters with respect to Node density and node location. Simulation analysis of the proposed energy efficient routing protocol provides high performance in energy utilization, packet delivery ratio, packet loss and Average delay compared against the conventional protocols on propagation of the data through sink node to base station.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skobelev, P.

The following idea is proved: development of Earth remote sensing systems needs changing of approach to planning of their application. Problem statement is described. As criteria of efficiency, information delivery time, resolution and cost of request execution are used.

The main objective of the problem is to make the robot move from starting position to goal position while avoiding all obstacles and follow the possible shortest path. For solving the path planning problem, a new objective function is developed. By optimizing the developed objective function the global best particle is determined among the swarm. Thereby, the robot moves further towards the global best position. The robot will continuously move to these intermediate positions until it reaches the final destination. Simulation showing navigation of robots towards goal position is done with MATLAB 2013b.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2015 GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (GCCT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbera, S.</author><author>Stallo, C.</author><author>Savarese, G.</author><author>Ruggieri, M.</author><author>Cacucci, S.</author><author>Fedi, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Geo-Referenced Swarm Agents Enabling System: Theory and Demo Application</title><secondary-title>UKSim/AMSS 1st International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>UKSIM-AMSS FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, MODELLING AND SIMULATION</full-title></periodical><pages>100-+</pages><keywords><keyword>Cooperative Multi-Agent (CMS)</keyword><keyword>GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)</keyword><keyword>Microcontroller (mu C) Evaluation Board</keyword><keyword>USB (Universal Serial Bus) Protocol</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Soc</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-5984-1</isbn><abstract>The evolution of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) systems capabilities will result in more increasing autonomy and mobility of ICT devices. In this scenario, Cooperative Multi-Robot / Multi-Sensor systems represent a new generation of ICT systems [1] [2], where mobile physical agents, equipped with sensors and/or actuators, may replace human operators in performing tasks in hazardous or risky environments. In this context the Center for TeleInFrastruktur (CTIF) Italy, with its headquarter at University of Rome "Tor Vergata", and the Italian company Space Software Italia (SSI), have realized a device that allows to mobile physical agents to perform operations within a spatial-temporal area defined by mission data. Such a device is enough small to be easily integrated within physical agents. Moreover, changing not so much software and no modifying hardware, we have implemented several functions. The system is geo-referenced since it foresees a GPS receiver assembled in the device that communicates with a microcontroller. A demo has been developed by us in order to simulate a geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system. The paper aims at showing the geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system architecture together with the development issues. The results of the experimental campaign are also presented.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Los Alamitos</custom1><custom3>UKSIM-AMSS FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, MODELLING AND SIMULATION</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Agarwal, Siddhartha</author><author>Pape, Louis E.</author><author>Dagli, Cihan H.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Dagli, C.

Generating architectures for a SoS is a multi-objective optimization problem with large number of variables and constraints. The paper presents several of computational intelligence techniques that can generate SoS architectures, such as genetic algorithms (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with Type 2 Fuzzy logic nets. The Maritime search and rescue (SAR) was used as a SoS domain scenario to both implement and demonstrate the architecting methodology. SAR utilizes a variety of systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), coordination command control, communication systems and other larger manned vessels. The proposed methodology delivers SoS architects of SAR missions the ability to exploit the interdependence among all systems as well as individual system's inherent characteristics to satisfy stakeholders' desired attributes. The architect is thus able to design architectures that are robust, efficient, net-centric, and affordable. (C) 2014 The Authors.

At the first level of hierarchy, we aggregate the high-dimensional control system of the swarm into a small-dimensional control system capturing its essential features. These features describe the position of the swarm in the world and its size. At the second level, we reduce the problem of controlling the essential features of the swarm to a model-checking problem. In the obtained hierarchical framework, high-level specifications given in natural language, such as linear temporal logic formulas over linear predicates in the essential features, are automatically mapped to provably correct robot control laws. For the particular case of an abstraction based on centroid and variance, we show that swarm cohesion, interrobot collision avoidance, and environment containment can also be specified and automatically guaranteed in our framework.

Complex formation configurations can be of interest to be the central element in an exhibition or maximize surface coverage for surveillance of a specific area. Existing algorithms that enable complex configurations usually require a centralized control, a communication protocol among the swarm in order to achieve consensus, or predefined instructions for individual agents. Nonetheless, trivial shapes such as flocks can be accomplished with low sensing and interaction requirements. We propose a pattern formation algorithm that enables a variety of shape configurations with a distributed, communication-free and index-free implementation with collision avoidance. Our algorithm is based on a formation definition that does not require indexing of the agents. We show the potential of the algorithm by simulating the formation of non-trivial shapes such as a wedge and a T-shaped configuration. We compare the performance of the algorithm for single and double integrator models for the dynamics of the agents. Finally, we run a preliminary test of our algorithm by implementing it with a group of small cars equipped with a Lidar for sensing and orientation calculation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) has identified at least twenty enabling and enhancing goals to fulfill the existing lunar exploration Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG). Several of these goals will require multi-asset missions to the surface of the Moon involving human and machine interaction, as well as access to a ground station on Earth. Therefore, a communication enabling constellation deployed around the moon will serve as a crucial enabling technology for such missions. However, the limited orbital stability of lunar orbits constrains the use of traditional central body orbits for designing these constellations. The Earth-Moon Lagrange points, on the other hand, offer a viable location to deploy these constellations. The stationarity of the Lagrange points coupled with the fact that they have a large line of sight access area to the Moon's surface makes them a viable candidate for deploying constellations with a minimal number of spacecraft. However, the design of a Lagrange point constellation mission is not straight forward. This involves selecting the Lagrange points that offer the optimal coverage, optimal quasi-stationary trajectories around these Lagrange points, the optimal transfer to these trajectories, and the design of the constituent spacecraft. Clearly, this multi-disciplinary problem can benefit from a unifying mission design architecture that simultaneously handles the above-mentioned challenges. In our previous work, we developed the Integrated Design Engineering and Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software do design swarm missions to solar system small bodies. This work will focus on extending the capability of the IDEAS architecture to design optimal constellations deployed at the Earth-Moon Lagrange points. The constellation will be designed to act as a relay network to Earth with a minimum number of spacecraft. The performance of the constellation will be noted by studying the accessible regions on the surface of the moon. The approach taken by this work is as follows. We begin by modeling the coverage of spacecraft antenna by studying the accessible areas. The spacecraft will be assumed to be in halo orbits about the colinear Lagrange points. A selection scheme for the halo orbits is then discussed in order to coverage, synchronization, and stability requirements. Finally, the principles described are demonstrated by designing a Lagrange point constellation with three spacecraft that have access to at least 85% of the Moon's surface and can communicate with at least 70% of the surface at any given instant. The requirements and performance of this constellation are then evaluated assuming state-of-the-art hardware capabilities. The results indicate successful performance of the developed algorithms thus enabling the IDEAS architecture to generate holistic optimal designs which will greatly increase the returns of the future missions to the Moon.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2020 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE (AEROCONF 2020)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lakas, Abderrahmane</author><author>Belkacem, Abdelkader Nasreddine</author><author>Al Hassani, Shamsa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Adaptive Multi-clustered Scheme for Autonomous UAV Swarms</title><secondary-title>16th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IEEE IWCMC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2020 16TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE, IWCMC</full-title></periodical><pages>1567-1572</pages><keywords><keyword>UAV swarm</keyword><keyword>leader-follower</keyword><keyword>multi-cluster</keyword><keyword>swarm stability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72813-129-0</isbn><abstract>Swarm technology for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has gained popularity in the last few years due to their potential for civilian and military applications. Intelligent swarm systems are very efficient at solving group-level problems and their capability to accomplish complex missions with no or little human intervention. One of the most challenging problems is operating in environments with surrounding obstacles such as buildings, thus, often obstructing inter-UAV communication. A UAV swarm is required to maintain continuous communication between its members and preserve the stability of its formation while flying towards an ultimate goal. In this paper we propose MSCS, a new cooperative and adaptive scheme for multi-clustered autonomous UAV swarms. This schemes allows several UAVs operating in a swarm formation to coordinate their navigation and path planning operations by using an adaptive multi-clustered leader-follower approach. The swarm members follow a dynamically elected leader based on the UAV with best fit to lead the swarm towards the destination. The coordination of the UAVs is achieved through SBP (Swarm Broadcast Protocol), a single-hop broadcast UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication protocol, which allows swarm members to exchange information about their current location and their local cluster leader. We present a set of performance results, which show that this scheme contributes efficiently at maintaining the swarm formation's stability at acceptable density and disconnection ratio.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2020 16TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE, IWCMC</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leng, Yuquan</author><author>Zhang, Yang</author><author>He, Xu</author><author>Zhou, Weijia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Algorithm for Foraging and Building Task on a Novel Swarm Robotic Platform</title><secondary-title>2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND BIOMIMETICS IEEE-ROBIO 2014</full-title></periodical><pages>2501-2506</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4799-7397-2</isbn><abstract>Foraging Task is a typical task on swarm robotic and Building Task (extend from blocks world) is widely used for testing performance of task planning in multi-robots.

The platform is composed of three parts: active region, modules and many robots called Socibots. In order to execute the task automatically and effectively, we propose a new system architecture including three layers: human-computer interaction layer (HCI), planning layer and execution layer. For the same reason, we put forward a novel algorithm to adjust individual behavior dynamically. As a result of our experiments, Socibots use only local information and do not need communication with others in forage, and fewer individuals are centralized control for building task. The architecture and algorithm are effective in swarm robotics, which guide system to perform complex task with less burden.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND BIOMIMETICS IEEE-ROBIO 2014</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Kefan</author><author>Lv, Na</author><author>Zhao, Shanghong</author><author>Wang, Xiang</author><author>Zhao, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Scheme for Improving the Communications Efficiency Between the Control Plane and Data Plane of the SDN-Enabled Airborne Tactical Network</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>37286-37301</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>software-defined networking</keyword><keyword>communication protocol</keyword><keyword>CHALLENGES</keyword><keyword>airborne tactical network</keyword><keyword>Aviation swarm</keyword><keyword>transmission framework</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852707</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the battle field becoming more challenging, the aviation swarm is considered a promising organization of air combat forces to execute both combat and non-combat air missions. As a critical component of the aviation swarm, the airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communications capability, enabling information sharing between both manned and unmanned military aircrafts as well as surface and ground platforms. The de ficiencies of legacy ATNs, particularly their inability to meet the communications demands of the aviation swarm, motivated us to employ the software-de fined networking (SDN) paradigm to the ATN and to design an SDN-enabled ATN (SD-ATN) for the aviation swarm. For the SDN paradigm, the communications efficiency between the control plane and the data plane directly impacts the normal operations of the network, raising a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN, which is that how to ensure the QoS requirements of the non-elastic information transmitted between the control plane and the data plane (non-elastic C/D information) is met. To address this issue, a transmission framework is first proposed to make it practical to provide dedicated QoS guarantee for the non-elastic C/D information. Then, a communication protocol is designed based on the proposed framework, aiming at transmitting the non-elastic C/D information in a reliable and real-time manner. The simulation results show that, in the aviation environment, our scheme does improve the transmission efficiency of the non-elastic C/D information, which performs better than legacy solutions.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Jiayong</author><author>Li, Qi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Construction and Analysis of Urban Cultural Plane Space Mode considering Particle Swarm Cultural Scientific Computing Algorithm</title><secondary-title>SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS</full-title><abbr-1>Secur.

This paper aims to construct and analyze the plane space mode of urban culture based on the particle swarm cultural scientific computing algorithm. This article first explains the concept of urban cultural space. Urban cultural space uses urban spatial structure as a media carrier and uses urban cultural time for vertical extension and development; then we proposed the particle swarm cultural scientific calculation algorithm and gave the particle swarm algorithm flowchart; then based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the evaluation of the configuration performance of urban cultural facilities is researched and discussed, and at the same time, the evolution law of urban spatial morphology is explored based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The particle swarm algorithm is a random search algorithm based on group cooperation developed by simulating the foraging behavior of birds. Urban cultural space is the development of urban space based on urban culture. It plays a special and important role in urban cultural development and urban space planning. According to the statistics of the survey and research results, the utilization rate of city-level cultural facilities in City A is 77, the utilization rate of district-level cultural facilities is 72, the utilization rate of street-community cultural facilities is 69, and the overall evaluation score is 70. It shows that there are significant differences in the actual use of cultural facilities, so it is particularly important to eliminate the differences in the use of cultural facilities between urban and rural areas. In the exploration of the law of urban spatial morphology evolution, it is found that the number of college students, total real estate investment, urban population, and total commercial housing sales have a significant impact on urban spatial expansion and evolution.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guerber, Christophe</author><author>Royer, Mickael</author><author>Larrieu, Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine Learning and Software Defined Network to secure communications in a swarm of drones</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Securing the communication taking place with the drones and especially in the network of a swarm, is of primary importance to allow a safe integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles into air traffic. Drones are subject to a range of attacks, from GPS jamming to application bug exploits. Among these attacks, and irrespective to whether they have already been implemented or not, communication is one of the main contributors, both as a vector and as a target. In this article, we use previous work on security threats concerning drones to identify two main types of attack in a network of drones: intrusion from the outside and network usage from inside. We demonstrate the robustness of the Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture facing most common attacks from the outside. In addition, we propose a traffic injection detection technique and corresponding countermeasures based on SDN flow counters. Finally, we present an innovative machine learning solution based on Random Forest Classifier to address insider attacks, relying solely on flow creation events. We propose two specific features that characterizes the activity in the network. They allow detecting common network attacks such as denial of service, port scanning and brute force and are easily available to the controller. Detection performance of these abnormal behaviors are promising, both in terms of true positive and false negative, and in terms of detection delay. Detection of these common attacks will allow tightening of security in such wireless network by denying further access to the network by rogue nodes.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Hsu-Chih</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FPGA-Based Parallel Metaheuristic PSO Algorithm and Its Application to Global Path Planning for Autonomous Robot Navigation</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT &amp; ROBOTIC SYSTEMS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT &amp; ROBOTIC SYSTEMS</full-title><abbr-1>J.

To do so, we introduce Maple, an automatic design method that combines predefined modules-low-level behaviors and conditions-into a behavior tree that encodes the individual behavior of each robot of the swarm. We present three empirical studies based on two missions: AGGREGATION and FORAGING. To explore the strengths and weaknesses of adopting behavior trees as a control architecture, we compare Maple with Chocolate, a previously proposed automatic design method that uses probabilistic finite state machines instead. In the first study, we assess Maple's ability to produce control software that crosses the reality gap satisfactorily. In the second study, we investigate Maple's performance as a function of the design budget, that is, the maximum number of simulation runs that the design process is allowed to perform. In the third study, we explore a number of possible variants of Maple that differ in the constraints imposed on the structure of the behavior trees generated. The results of the three studies indicate that, in the context of swarm robotics, behavior trees might be appealing but in many settings do not produce better solutions than finite state machines.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Bo</author><author>Hu, Chaofang</author><author>Zhou, Yimin</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Fu, M.</author><author>Sun, J.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>The Ground Station Design for Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Control</title><secondary-title>38th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 38TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE (CCC)</full-title></periodical><pages>8248-8253</pages><keywords><keyword>Software</keyword><keyword>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</keyword><keyword>Communication Protocol</keyword><keyword>Ground Station Control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-988-15639-7-2</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.23919/chicc.2019.8865734</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the development of Science and technology and reform in military field, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays more and more key role in the current world.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has traditionally launched single spacecraft missions that are served by the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) program. Operations on SCaN networks are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and often each asset serves a single user spacecraft at a time. Recent movement towards swarm missions could make the current approach unsustainable. Additionally, the integration of commercial communication service providers will substantially increase the data transfer options available to new missions. NASA science missions have found benefit in launching swarms of spacecraft, allowing coordinated simultaneous observations from different perspectives. Inter-spacecraft communication (mesh networking) is an enabler for this architecture, as are CubeSats that allow cost-effective provisioning of distributed mission assets. As more complex swarm missions launch, one challenge is coordinating communication within the swarm and choosing the appropriate mechanism for telemetry, tracking, control, and data services to and from Earth. Cognitive communications research conducted by SCaN aims to mitigate the increasing communication complexity for mission users by increasing the autonomy of links, networks, and service scheduling. By considering automation techniques including recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, cognitive algorithms and related approaches enable increased mission science return, improved resource utilization for service provider networks, and resiliency in unpredictable or unplanned environments. The Cognitive Communications Project at the NASA Glenn Research Center develops applications of data-driven, nondeterministic methods to improve the autonomy of space communication. The project emphasizes the development of decentralized space networks with artificial intelligence agents optimizing communication link throughput, data muting, and system-wide asset management. This chapter discusses the objectives, approaches, and opportunities of the research to address growing needs of the space communications community.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Stevenage</custom1><custom3>ADVANCES IN COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEMS 2</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, Gagan Deep</author><author>Prateek, Manish</author><author>Kumar, Sunil</author><author>Verma, Madhushi</author><author>Singh, Dilbag</author><author>Lee, Heung-No</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hybrid Genetic Firefly Algorithm-Based Routing Protocol for VANETs</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>9142-9151</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Reliability</keyword><keyword>Genetic algorithms</keyword><keyword>swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Clustering algorithms</keyword><keyword>Vehicular ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>routing</keyword><keyword>Routing protocols</keyword><keyword>genetic algorithm</keyword><keyword>Routing</keyword><keyword>AODV</keyword><keyword>VANET</keyword><keyword>Firefly optimization</keyword><keyword>IMPROVEMENT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3142811</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) are used for efficient communication among the vehicles to vehicle (V2V) infrastructure. Currently, VANETs are facing node management, security, and routing problems in V2V communication. Intelligent transportation systems have raised the research opportunity in routing, security, and mobility management in VANETs. One of the major challenges in VANETs is the optimization of routing for desired traffic scenarios. Traditional protocols such as Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), and Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV) are perfect for generic mobile nodes but do not fit for VANET due to the high and dynamic nature of vehicle movement. Similarly, swarm intelligence routing algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) routing techniques are partially successful for addressing optimized routing for sparse, dense, and realistic traffic network scenarios in VANET. Also, the majority of metaheuristics techniques suffer from premature convergence, being stuck in local optima, and poor convergence speed problems. Therefore, a Hybrid Genetic Firefly Algorithm-based Routing Protocol (HGFA) is proposed for faster communication in VANET. Features of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) are integrated with the Firefly algorithm and applied in VANET routing for both sparse and dense network scenarios. Extensive comparative analysis reveals that the proposed HGFA algorithm outperforms Firefly and PSO techniques with 0.77% and 0.55% of significance in dense network scenarios and 0.74% and 0.42% in sparse network scenarios, respectively.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kang, Min Wook</author><author>Chung, Yun Won</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Efficient Energy Saving Scheme for Base Stations in 5G Networks with Separated Data and Control Planes Using Particle Swarm Optimization</title><secondary-title>ENERGIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENERGIES</full-title><abbr-1>Energies</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1417</pages><volume>10</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>DESIGN</keyword><keyword>energy saving</keyword><keyword>5G networks</keyword><keyword>GREEN CELLULAR NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>heterogeneous network</keyword><keyword>MECHANISMS</keyword><keyword>separated data and control planes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>SEP 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1996-1073</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/en10091417</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reducing energy consumption of mobile communication networks has gained significant attentions since it takes a major part of the total energy consumption of information and communication technology (ICT). In this paper, we consider 5G networks with heterogeneous macro cells and small cells, where data and control planes are separated. We consider two types of data traffic, i.e., low rate data traffic and high rate data traffic. In basic separation architecture, a macro cell base station (MBS) manages control signals, while a small cell base station (SBS) manages both low rate data traffic and high rate data traffic. In the considered modified separation architecture, an MBS manages control signals and low rate data traffic, while an SBS manages high rate data traffic. Then, an efficient energy saving scheme for base stations (BSs) is proposed, where the state of a BS is determined depending on the number of user equipments (UEs) that request high rate data traffic and the number of UEs that exist under the overlapping areas commonly covered by the considered BS and the neighbor BSs. We formulate an optimization problem for the proposed energy saving scheme and obtain the solution using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Numerical results show that the proposed energy saving scheme in the modified separated network architecture has better energy efficiency compared to the conventional energy saving schemes in both basic and modified separated network architectures. Also, the proposed energy saving scheme has lower aggregate delay.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khan, Sara Imran</author><author>Qadir, Zakria</author><author>Munawar, Hafiz Suliman</author><author>Nayak, Soumya Ranjan</author><author>Budati, Anil Kumar</author><author>Verma, K.

In the medical domain, UAV can play a vital role in the fast and efficient delivery of first aid and medical supplies. In the current study, safe and smooth UAV navigation from the initial position to the medical emergency location was achieved with optimal path planning through a proposed algorithm. On the notification of patient about his health condition using GSM band, doctor drone was sent from the nearest hospital facility. To avoid traffic congestion the doctor drone provides medical assistance with minimum computational time and transportation cost. The vehicle routing was carried out through proposed algorithms i.e., capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The comparison between the algorithms was carried out at different vehicle capacities and numbers. The CVRP was found to outperform other algorithms with a runtime of 0.06 sec and cost of 419 at vehicle capacity 10, which is 50% less having the same number of the vehicles but increasing the capacities to 20. The results indicate that the effective path planning method could be applied to provide medical aid in real-time with efficacy.

In particular, we consider a decentralized leader-follower architecture for multiple mobile manipulators, where the leading robot, which has exclusive knowledge of both the object's desired configuration and the position of the obstacles in the workspace, tries to navigate the overall formation to the desired configuration while at the same time it avoids collisions with the obstacles. On the other hand, the followers estimate the objects desired trajectory profile via novel prescribed performance estimation laws that drive the estimation errors to an arbitrarily small predefined residual set. Moreover, a navigation function-based scheme is innovatively combined with adaptive control to deal with parametric uncertainty. Hence, the current state of the art in robust motion planning and collision avoidance is extended by studying second order non-linear dynamics with parametric uncertainty. Furthermore, the feedback relies exclusively on each robot's force/torque, position as well as velocity measurements and no explicit information is exchanged online among the robots, thus reducing the required communication bandwidth and increasing robustness. Finally, two simulation studies clarify the proposed methodology and verify its efficiency.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tran, Duy Khanh</author><author>Komarov, Igor</author><author>Le, Duy Don</author><author>Iureva, Radda</author><author>Chuprov, Sergey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TRA: Effective Authentication Mechanism for Swarms Of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title><secondary-title>IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2020 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)</full-title></periodical><pages>1852-1858</pages><keywords><keyword>unmanned aerial vehicle</keyword><keyword>security</keyword><keyword>swarm</keyword><keyword>authentication</keyword><keyword>SCHEME</keyword><keyword>decentralized approach</keyword><keyword>KEY AGREEMENT PROTOCOL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72812-547-3</isbn><abstract>The swarm of the unmanned aerial vehicles is researched to meet the special mission requirements given both in the military and civilian sectors such as fire detection, sky reconnaissance, and other areas of human activities. These swarms can directly contact via ground control station or direct communication. However, when communicating remotely via wireless and fine maneuverability of the unmanned aerial vehicle, many mechanisms face several security gaps, such as the authentication mechanism in enemy attacks. In this study, we propose safe and effective authentication mechanism appropriate for the dynamic environment of the unmanned aerial vehicle. In the frames of this approach, a new operating mechanism in the proposed protocol is described. The protocol provides authentication security for swarms of the unmanned aerial vehicle.

The configuration of these tasks related to single or multi-robot algorithms depends on the individual requirements of the scenario (i.e. number of entities, communication bandwidth, failure assumptions). Therefore, the developer may decide to run a path planning algorithm individually for each robot to avoid an additional exchange of information. For a scenario with a large communication bandwidth, a planner in the global context would be more suitable in order to receive an optimal result. In this paper we present an architecture that implements this decision online. Our context-aware task controller evaluates the communication situation and triggers a context switch (global, local, individual) of the task execution. By shifting the decision from design-time to run-time, we close the gap between supervision and swarm approaches and provide an optimized behavior of a multi-robot application within the current configuration.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2016 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND FACTORY AUTOMATION (ETFA)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dang-Ngoc, Hanh</author><author>Nguyen, Diep N.</author><author>Ho-Van, Khuong</author><author>Hoang, Dinh Thai</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Eryk</author><author>Pham, Quoc-Viet</author><author>Hwang, Won-Joo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Secure Swarm UAV-Assisted Communications With Cooperative Friendly Jamming</title><secondary-title>IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Internet Things J.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>25596-25611</pages><volume>9</volume><number>24</number><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)</keyword><keyword>NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>RESOURCE-ALLOCATION</keyword><keyword>Amplify-and-forward (AF)</keyword><keyword>cooperative friendly jamming</keyword><keyword>energy harvesting (EH)</keyword><keyword>relaying network</keyword><keyword>secrecy outage probability (SOP)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>DEC 15 2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2327-4662</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/JIOT.2022.3197975</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article proposes a cooperative friendly jamming framework for swarm unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying networks with wireless energy harvesting (EH). In particular, we consider a swarm of hovering UAVs that relays information from a terrestrial base station to a distant mobile user and simultaneously generates friendly jamming signals to interfere/obfuscate an eavesdropper. Due to the limited energy of the UAVs, we develop a collaborative time-switching relaying protocol that allows the UAVs to collaborate in harvesting wireless energy, relay information, and jam the eavesdropper. To evaluate the performance, we derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for two popular detection techniques at the eavesdropper, i.e., selection combining and maximum-ratio combining. Monte Carlo simulations are then used to validate the theoretical SOP derivation. Using the derived SOP, one can obtain engineering insights to optimize the EH time and the number of UAVs in the swarm to achieve a given secrecy protection level. Furthermore, simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of SOP compared to the conventional AF relaying system. The analytical SOP derived in this work can also be helpful in future UAV secure-communication optimizations (e.g., trajectory and locations of UAVs). As an example, we present a case study to find the optimal corridor to locate the swarm so as to minimize the system SOP. Our proposed framework helps secure communications for various applications that require large coverage, e.g., industrial IoT, smart city, intelligent transportation systems, and critical IoT infrastructures, such as energy and water.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ahmad, Mobeen</author><author>Abdullah, Muhammad</author><author>Moon, Hyeonjoon</author><author>Yoo, Seong Joon</author><author>Han, Dongil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Image Classification Based on Automatic Neural Architecture Search Using Binary Crow Search Algorithm</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>189891-189912</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>deep learning</keyword><keyword>image classification</keyword><keyword>NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>AutoML</keyword><keyword>crow search algorithm</keyword><keyword>hyperparameter optimization</keyword><keyword>metaheuristic</keyword><keyword>Neural architecture search</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3031599</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Neural architectures have accelerated the advancement in various domains by enabling automatic pattern detection, image classification, audio recognition, and face recognition etc. However, they are computationally expensive to design and expert knowledge in various domains is required. In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed to search for novel architectures without human intervention that can achieve comparable performance to those of human-designed architectures. This work is inspired by current neural architecture search approaches based on reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm. However, not much attention is paid towards swarm intelligence metaheuristics-based neural architecture search. A framework is proposed for automatically designing neural architectures based on a swarm intelligence metaheuristic: Crow Search Algorithm. First, Crow Search Algorithm is integrated with binary network representation. To make it compatible for Neural Architecture Search, the original distance metric is replaced with hamming distance-based similarity measure. Second, the tuning parameters of Crow Search Algorithm are reduced by replacing the static flight length parameter with our dynamic flight length distribution algorithm. Third, the target selection method (random selection) is replaced by tournament select method. The proposed framework is used to search for architectures on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets and achieved 0.18% 3.48% and 15.64% test error, respectively. Furthermore, small-scale transfer experiments are conducted to search architectures for Tiny ImageNet and achieved 34.43% test error. Nonparametric statistical analysis is performed to validate the impact of each modification in improving the quality of search space exploration. The proposed framework has achieved comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approaches, with a comparatively simpler approach and minimum human intervention. The proposed framework can be used to develop completely automated systems for designing architectures for various data-based classification applications.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fitwi, Alem H.</author><author>Nagothu, Deeraj</author><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Blasch, Erik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A DISTRIBUTED AGENT-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR A CONSTELLATION OF DRONES IN A MILITARY OPERATION</title><secondary-title>Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC)</full-title></periodical><pages>2548-2559</pages><keywords><keyword>OPPORTUNITIES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72813-283-9</isbn><abstract>A seamless communication capability is important in military operations. Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2019 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Ruiwen</author><author>Song, Bifeng</author><author>Pei, Yang</author><author>Yun, Qijia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved method for subsystems performance trade-off in system-of-systems oriented design of UAV swarms</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS</full-title><abbr-1>J.

In the SoS oriented design, the subsystems performance trade-off is the basis of design decisions. In the trade-off for surveillance missions, most previous works do not consider track reporting and mainly focus on the design of platforms. An improved method for the subsystems performance trade-off in the SoS oriented UAV swarm design is proposed. Within an improved design framework with subsystems disaggregation, this method is characterized by treating platforms, sensors, and communications as equally important subsystems, integrating operational strategies into the trade-off, and enabling the trade-off for track reporting. Those advantages are achieved by a behavior-based modular model structure for agent-based operational modeling and simulation. In addition, a method of analyzing the bounds of the communication range is also presented. Simulation experiments are conducted by using precision-based simulation replication rules and surrogate modeling methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that the configuration of area partitioning changes the trade space of subsystems performances, indicating the necessity of integrating operational strategies into the conceptual design.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Xiaolin</author><author>Fu, Xiuwen</author><author>Yang, Yongsheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy-Efficient Trajectory Planning Algorithm Based on Multi-Objective PSO for the Mobile Sink in Wireless Sensor Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>176204-176217</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>trajectory planning</keyword><keyword>SYSTEM</keyword><keyword>DESIGN</keyword><keyword>PROTOCOL</keyword><keyword>load balance of rendezvous nodes</keyword><keyword>Mobile sink</keyword><keyword>MOPSO</keyword><keyword>WSNS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957834</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), collecting data with mobile sinks is an effective way to solve the "energy hole problem''. However, most of existing algorithms of mobile sinks ignore the load balance of rendezvous nodes, which will significantly shorten the network lifetime. Moreover, most mobile sinks are usually required to visit locations of sensor nodes without taking advantage of their communication ranges. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-efficient trajectory planning algorithm (EETP) based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) to shorten the trajectory length of the mobile sink and balance the load of rendezvous nodes. EETP aims to reduce the delay in data delivery and prolong the network lifetime. To shorten the trajectory length of the mobile sink, we design a mechanism to select potential visiting points within communication overlapping ranges of sensor nodes, rather than locations of sensor nodes. Additionally, according to trajectory characteristics of the mobile sink, we design an effective trajectory encoding method that can generate a trajectory containing an unfixed number of visiting points. The simulation results show that the proposed EETP is superior to existing WRP, CB and the MOPSO-based algorithm, in terms of delay in data delivery, network lifetime and energy consumption.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Soon-gyo</author><author>Kang, Byungseok</author><author>Yeoum, Sanggil</author><author>Choo, Hyunseung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trail-Using Ant Behavior Based Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is one of the popular algorithms in SI. In the last decade, several routing protocols based on ACO algorithm have been developed for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Such routing protocols are very flexible in distributed system but generate a lot of additional traffic and thus increase communication overhead. This paper proposes a new routing protocol reducing the overhead to provide energy efficiency. The proposed protocol adopts not only the foraging behavior of ant colony but also the trail-using behavior which has never been adopted in routing. By employing the behaviors, the protocol establishes and manages the routing trails energy efficiently in the whole network. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol has low communication overhead and reduces up to 55% energy consumption compared to the existing ACO algorithm.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuru, Kaya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Planning the Future of Smart Cities With Swarms of Fully Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using a Novel Framework</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6571-6595</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Task analysis</keyword><keyword>Batteries</keyword><keyword>Internet of Things</keyword><keyword>Internet of Things (IoT)</keyword><keyword>Automation</keyword><keyword>Automation of Everything (AoE)</keyword><keyword>Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)</keyword><keyword>Internet of Everything (IoE)</keyword><keyword>Internet-of-Drones (IoD)</keyword><keyword>smart city</keyword><keyword>Real-time systems</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization</keyword><keyword>NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>ARCHITECTURE</keyword><keyword>DESIGN</keyword><keyword>CHALLENGES</keyword><keyword>DEPLOYMENT</keyword><keyword>OPPORTUNITIES</keyword><keyword>INTERNET</keyword><keyword>RESOURCE-ALLOCATION</keyword><keyword>UAV COMMUNICATION</keyword><keyword>WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3049094</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - self-governing in the aerospace discipline has been a remarkable research area with the development of the advanced bespoke microcontrollers embedded with advanced AI techniques for the last several decades. The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Sung-Chan</author><author>Ahn, Il-Yeop</author><author>Park, Jong-Hong</author><author>Kim, Jaeho</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards Real-Time Data Delivery in oneM2M Platform for UAV Management System</title><secondary-title>18th Annual International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication (ICEIC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATION (ICEIC)</full-title></periodical><pages>516-518</pages><keywords><keyword>UAV</keyword><keyword>drone swarm</keyword><keyword>UAV management system</keyword><keyword>oneM2M standard</keyword><keyword>real-time data delivery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-89-950044-4-9</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.23919/elinfocom.2019.8706417</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents oneM2M standard platform architecture design and its implementation which supports real-time data delivery for UAV management system. Recently, a UAV swarm service is getting a lot of attention since compared to the single UAV, a UAV swarm can reduce time of executing various mission activities such as remote sensing, surveillance, search and rescue. However, to support those UAV swarm service scenarios, UAV management system should be involved and moreover, the system requires a real-time data delivery feature due to the high cruise speed of the UAVs and the low-latency constraints of the command and control message.

The objective of the RAS project is to develop a distributed multi-layer autonomous UAS planning and control technology for gathering intelligence in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) environments populated by intelligent adaptive adversaries. These resilient autonomous systems are able to navigate through hostile environments while collecting intelligence and minimizing the loss of assets. Our approach incorporates artificial life concepts, with the high-level architecture divided into three biologically inspired meta-layers: cyber-physical, reactive, and deliberative. Each meta-layer is a combination of N layers, each representing simple behavior, and collectively having a dynamic level of influence over the behavior of the agent. Algorithms within each layer act on a combination of perceptions, memory, and intents. Perceptions represent a filtered view of reality, abstracted in the layer immediately below, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next highest layer. Intents represent a recommended action output from the layer above, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next lowest layer. Each cycle, perceptions and intents are cleared. Memory permeates each layer, and allows the layers to retain some knowledge from previous cycles. Fast-reactive control systems in low meta-layers ensure a stable environment supporting cognitive function on higher meta-layers. The key concepts of our approach are: A layered architecture of intelligence on a spectrum from reactive to deliberative; the use of artificial life algorithms providing robust, complex behavior from a set of simple rules; communication of information between agents via observation; the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to assist the team in selecting and adapting the best solutions for each layer. This distributed cooperative system of intelligent assets will provide adaptable, scalable performance to accomplish mission goals in challenging environments.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2018 IEEE/AIAA 37TH DIGITAL AVIONICS SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (DASC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghdiri, Oussama</author><author>Jaafar, Wael</author><author>Alfattani, Safwan</author><author>Abderrazak, Jihene Ben</author><author>Yanikomeroglu, Halim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Offline and Online UAV-Enabled Data Collection in Time-Constrained IoT Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Trans.

Particularly, time-sensitive and energy-limited IoT networks located in hard-to-reach areas require efficient/cost-effective data collection solution. To address this matter, we consider a multi-UAV enabled IoT network, where several UAVs collect data from time-constrained sensor nodes (SNs). In our framework, SNs are managed by cluster heads (CHs), then UAVs collect data from them. We formulate the problem of minimizing system's deployment costs and operating energy to collect data within deadlines, subject to communication, UAVs mission time, and battery capacity constraints. To solve it, we propose a two-step approach. In the first step, an efficient K-means based method groups SNs and deploys CHs. Then, UAV-based offline and online data collection methods are proposed. In the offline setting where the system's status is known beforehand, UAV paths are determined using near-optimal meta-heuristics. In simulations, the nearest-neighbor and Tabu search provided best offline performances, conditioned on the system's parameters. In the online setting where no system information is available, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approaches are proposed. Results demonstrate the superiority of the actor-critic solution.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yalcin, Sercan</author><author>Erdem, Ebubekir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A mobile sink path planning for wireless sensor networks based on priority-ordered dependent nonparametric trees</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

Moreover, mobile sinks ought to first collect data from nodes which have very important and dense data so that packet collision and loss can be prevented at an advanced level. For these purposes, the present paper proposes a new mobile path planning protocol by introducing priority-ordered dependent nonparametric trees (PoDNTs) for WSNs. Unlike traditional clustered or swarm intelligence topology-based routing methods, a topology which has hierarchical and dependent infinite tree structure provides a robust link connection between nodes, making it easier to reselect ancestor nodes (ANs). The proposed priority-ordered infinite trees are sampled in the specific time frames by introducing new equations and hierarchically associated with their child nodes starting from the root node. Hence, the nodes with the highest priority and energy that belong to the constructed tree family are selected as ANs with an opportunistic approach. A mobile sink simply visits these ANs to acquire data from all nodes in the network and return to where it started. As a result, the route traveled is assigned as the mobile path for the current round. We have performed comprehensive performance analysis to illustrate the effectiveness of the present study using NS-2 simulation environment. The present routing protocol has achieved better results than the other algorithms over various performance metrics.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buinhas, Luisa</author><author>Peytavi, Graciela G.</author><author>Foerstner, Roger</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Navigation and communication network for the Valles Marineris Explorer (VaMEx)</title><secondary-title>ACTA ASTRONAUTICA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACTA ASTRONAUTICA</full-title><abbr-1>Acta Astronaut.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>280-296</pages><volume>160</volume><keywords><keyword>Navigation</keyword><keyword>Mars</keyword><keyword>GNSS</keyword><keyword>Positioning</keyword><keyword>Cartographic triangulation</keyword><keyword>Coverage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>JUL 2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0094-5765, 1879-2030</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.actaastro.2019.04.032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With recent advances in robotics and space technology for the exploration of our Solar System, innovative mission concepts are being proposed to further extend our knowledge of our neighbouring planets and their satellites. VaMEx, abbreviation for Valles Marineris Explorer, is an example of such an initiative. VaMEx aims to survey the canyons of the Valles Marineris, for the duration of one year. A cluster of robotic elements is tasked with the planetary exploration activities. Due to the hazardous environment, it is required that these elements navigate autonomously, broadcast position information and exchange science data during the operational phase of the mission. To support these functions, a VaMEx space segment composed of one (or more) orbiter satellite(s) is proposed. Three possible swarm localization schemes were investigated: 1) radio positioning, 2) cartographic triangulation of ground features from optical images and 3) cartographic triangulation of radar persistent scatters. For each of the proposed navigation concepts, a suitable orbit constellation solution was assessed. Each solution was evaluated in terms of orbit stability, control effort and communications performance using metrics specific to each of the three concepts (length of pass, visibility gaps, geometry constraints, etc.). With the described navigation concept and mission analysis results, a preliminary operational architecture for the VaMEx space segment is conceived, taking into account existing technologies, communications performance, overall mission complexity and feasibility.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anupama, K.

To handle mobility, the MWSN node should be much more efficient than the nodes in static WSN. Moreover, a MWSN node should be capable of handling real time mobility control, path planning and navigation. The application domains of MWSN can be further expanded by incorporating swarm like intelligence in MWSN. We have developed a low cost, small form factor hardware platform which will function as a node in MWSN using custom off the shelf(COTS) products. Our mobile hardware platform, henceforth called as BSwarm robot supports self-assembly, to achieve complex tasks. The platform also support image assisted navigation and provides extensive I/O support for further feature expansion. The testbed consisting of multiple BSwarm robot can be utilized for the development and validation of algorithms/protocols related to MWSNs, distributed control of Swarm robots, real time image processing etc. BSwarm robot is a multi processor based robot designed in such a way that it can be used for applications which may demand varied degree of processing, communication and input-output capabilities. This paper also highlights major factors that can be taken into consideration while choosing the hardware platform for MWSNs so that the protocol stack development for MWSNs becomes easier.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, INFORMATICS, COMMUNICATION AND ENERGY SYSTEMS (SPICES)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCune, Ryan</author><author>Purta, Rachael</author><author>Dobski, Mikolaj</author><author>Jaworski, Artur</author><author>Madey, Greg</author><author>Wei, Yi</author><author>Madey, Alexander</author><author>Blake, M.

Swarm intelligent systems are not only efficient at solving group-level problems, but also decentralized, controllable by few simple parameters, making possible the command and control of UAV swarms by a single operator. Four separate but related projects are surveyed that explore the command and control of UAV swarms.

Cooperative, multiple robots are employed for many different tasks to increase the efficiency and success of a mission. However, many of the existing collective path planning approaches do not guarantee a reliable escape in environments with complex, non-convex obstacles without any prior knowledge. In this study, we developed a navigation framework for multi-robot systems in unknown areas that solely exploit the sensing information and shared data among the agents. The key contribution of this paper is the simultaneous, collision-free motion planning for fully autonomous robots in a collective manner. Furthermore, our communication architecture enables the robots to find an appropriate path to a desired, joint target position, despite the limited sensing and communication range.

Device swarms are smart, mobile, and interconnected devices that operate in large numbers and are likely to be part of emerging applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (lloTs). Swarm devices process and exchange safety, privacy, and mission-critical information. Thus, it is important to have a good code verification technique that scales to device swarms and establishes trust among collaborating devices. DADS has several advantages over current state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques: It is decentralized, has no single point of failure, and can handle changing topologies after nodes are compromised. DADS assures system resilience to node compromise/failure while guaranteeing only devices that execute genuine code remain part of the group. We conduct performance measurements of communication, computation, memory, and energy using the TrustLite embedded systems architecture in OMNeT++ simulation environment. We show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce communication cost and is very efficient in terms of computation, memory, and energy requirements. We also analyze security and show that DADS is very effective and robust against various attacks.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Senchuk, Dmitry</author><author>Meshcheryakov, Roman</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>AlJumeily, D.</author><author>Hind, J.</author><author>Mustafina, J.</author><author>AlHajj, A.</author><author>Hussain, A.</author><author>Magid, E.</author><author>Tawfik, H.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Control technology for remotely piloted air systems (RPAS)</title><secondary-title>12th International Conference on the Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENTS IN ESYSTEMS ENGINEERING (DESE 2019)</full-title></periodical><pages>472-476</pages><keywords><keyword>surveillance</keyword><keyword>RPAS</keyword><keyword>control</keyword><keyword>monitoring</keyword><keyword>tracking</keyword><keyword>swarm control</keyword><keyword>control technology</keyword><keyword>remote control systems</keyword><keyword>remotely piloted aircraft systems</keyword><keyword>search</keyword><keyword>unmanned aircraft vehicles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72813-021-7</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/DeSE.2019.00092</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) are capable to solve a wide range of application tasks, including ones with high requirements to the time limit of performance.

The AFSA-PSO algorithm successfully preserved the fast convergence and strong traceability of the original algorithm through particle self-adjustment and dynamic weights, and it effectively overcame its shortcomings, such as the tendency to fall into local optimum and lower convergence speed. In addition to accurately predicting normal passenger flow, the algorithm can also effectively identify and predict the large-scale tourist attractions passenger flow as it has strong applicability and robustness. Compared with single PSO or AFSA algorithms, the new algorithm has better prediction effects, such as faster convergence, lower average absolute percentage error, and a higher correlation coefficient with real values.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kong, Dong-Uck</author><author>An, Jinung</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Jeschke, S.</author><author>Liu, H.

Schools of naval mammals provide the proof that also individual members of the group can achieve higher leveled intelligence independent of the simplicity of their collective behavior. Due to their structurally and functionally modularized brain organization, dolphins are capable of language based communication and learning complex motions by human training. Inspired by dolphins, 3 modules for the behavior controller can be conceptualized. The swarming module optimized by evolutionary methods represents the basic behavior given in the natural environment. The mission module includes extendable sets of behavior primitives that can be structured by reinforcement learning. A knowledge based sensing module can be implemented separately to increase the information reliability. With this approach, subaqueous robot schools can be expected to perform more advanced tasks than just moving as a swarm.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Berlin</custom1><custom3>INTELLIGENT ROBOTICS AND APPLICATIONS, PT II</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daniel, Kai</author><author>Dusza, Bjoern</author><author>Lewandowski, Andreas</author><author>Wietfeld, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AirShield: A System-of-Systems MUAV Remote Sensing Architecture for Disaster Response</title><secondary-title>3rd Annual IEEE Systems Conference 2009</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS</full-title></periodical><pages>196-200</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-3462-6</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SYSTEMS.2009.4815797</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For clarification, containment and combat of large danger areas, fast and flexible survey of potentially contaminated areas is an emerging challenge.

Instead of sending specially equipped forces with expensive transport and measurement devices into the contaminated area, our proposed system makes use of an autonomous, wireless connected swarm of Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (WAV), often simply known as drones, that are featured with lightweight mobile sensor systems. In this paper we will be particularly focusing on the complex communication system, which on the one hand has to organize the on-board-communication between the control systems of the MUAV and the sensors and on the other hand has to establish wireless connections to the mission control center on the ground as well as to neighboring MUAVs in the air via a mesh network.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chiti, Francesco</author><author>Picchi, Roberto</author><author>Pierucci, Laura</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metropolitan Quantum-Drone Networking and Computing: A Software-Defined Perspective</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>126062-126073</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>UAV</keyword><keyword>Quantum cloud</keyword><keyword>quantum drone swarms</keyword><keyword>quantum internet</keyword><keyword>quantum key distribution</keyword><keyword>quantum software-defined networking</keyword><keyword>FOG</keyword><keyword>CAPACITY</keyword><keyword>ENTANGLEMENT</keyword><keyword>FIDELITY</keyword><keyword>HAZE</keyword><keyword>NM</keyword><keyword>SPACE OPTICAL COMMUNICATION</keyword><keyword>STATE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3226127</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Swarms of drones are utilized in a wide range of applications, considering that they can be deployed on-demand and are economically affordable. Furthermore, they can also have a significant role in the creation of future Quantum Networks (QNs). As a matter of fact, the use of drones allows deploying a non terrestrial Quantum Metropolitan Area Network (QMAN), overcoming Optical Fibers' (OFs) limits, due to the large percentage of photons that scatters before reaching the receiver. However, random fluctuations of drones' positions and atmospheric turbulence can affect the quality of the Free Space Optic (FSO) link with a significant impact on performance. Considering that Quantum Drone Networks (QDNs) require significant control, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm can play a key role in their provisioning. Specifically, an SDN Controller is responsible for managing the global strategies for the distribution of end-to-end (E2E) entangled pairs. Therefore, this paper provides the design of an SDN-based architecture for supporting high-performance Metropolitan Quantum Drone Networks (MQDNs) with a specific protocol for creating entanglement between two Ground Stations (GSs) through the swarm of drones. The proposed architecture can be employed for distributed quantum computing applications and entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) services. Moreover, a suited objective function to optimize the planning and operation of the swarm mission has been proposed. Finally, the paper provides a performance evaluation considering the most relevant metrics, such as fidelity, entanglement rate, and the overhead of the proposed protocol, pointing out that even higher performance than OFs is achievable.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Chuanxin</author><author>Wu, Changzhi</author><author>Chai, Jian</author><author>Wang, Xiangyu</author><author>Yang, Xinmin</author><author>Lee, Jae-Myung</author><author>Kim, Mi Jeong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decomposition-based multi-objective firefly algorithm for RFID network planning with uncertainty</title><secondary-title>APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING</full-title><abbr-1>Appl.

Due to the limited communication range between readers and tags, how to configure a RFID system in a large area is important but challenging. To configure a RFID system, most existing results are based on cost minimization through using 0/1 identification model. In practice, the system is interfered by environment and probabilistic model would be more reliable. To make sure the quality of the system, more objectives, such as interference and coverage, should be considered in addition to cost. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic-based multi-objective optimization model to address these challenges. The objectives to be optimized include number of readers, interference level and coverage of tags. A decomposition based firefly algorithm is designed to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. Virtual force is integrated into random walk to guide readers moving in order to enhance exploitation. Numerical simulations are introduced to demonstrate and validate our proposed method. Comparing with existing methods, such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization approaches, our proposed method can achieve better performance in terms of quality metric and generational distance under the same computational environment. However, the spacing metric of the proposed method is slightly inferior to those compared methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, since it preys on honey bees, its recent progression in Europe could soon pose a significant risk to the local apiculture activity. European beekeepers are therefore investigating adapted control strategies, including V. velutina nest destruction. Unfortunately, nest location pinpointing generally follows a manual process which can prove tedious, time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose the use of a network of micro aerial vehicles featuring autonomous and cooperative flight capabilities. We describe an adapted controlled mobility strategy and detail the design of our Virtual Force Protocol (VFP) which allows a swarm of vehicles to track and follow hornets to their nests, while maintaining connectivity through a wireless multi-hop communication route with a remote ground station used to store applicative data such as hornet trajectory and vehicle telemetry. In order to achieve the mission objectives with a minimum of vehicles, we identify through simulations appropriate value for the key parameters of VFP and discuss the obtained network performance.

This article looks at the emergent properties of the system as a whole based on local spacecraft behaviors, and how these behaviors can be adjusted to achieve mission goals. The significance of this approach is that it frees the ground station from the micromanagement of individual spacecraft (despite the lack of intersatellite links) which is a crucial requirement for the feasibility of future cluster/swarm missions. To understand the system fully, an analysis is presented for simple systems that have different characteristics. Performance is evaluated in terms of intuitive behaviors (greedy, considerate, proactive, and obstinate) that are mathematically defined. This reveals that performance can be steadily improved by making the behaviors more "self-aware." Simulations are then extended to swarms involving larger numbers of spacecraft to demonstrate scalability and more realistic scenarios for practicality. The final contribution of this work is to introduce various mechanisms for supervisors, and/or the ground station, to dynamically adjust behavior to achieve load balancing across the cluster.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Xiaoyan</author><author>Liu, Tianyi</author><author>Liu, Song</author><author>Kacimi, Rahim</author><author>Dhaou, Riadh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Priority-Based Data Collection for UAV-Aided Mobile Sensor Network</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3034</pages><volume>20</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>wireless sensor networks</keyword><keyword>data collection</keyword><keyword>INTERNET</keyword><keyword>collision-free</keyword><keyword>COMPLETION-TIME MINIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>mobile nodes</keyword><keyword>multiple unmanned aerial vehicles</keyword><keyword>TRAJECTORY DESIGN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>JUN 2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s20113034</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this work, we study data collection in multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The network topology is changing due to the mobility of the UAVs and the sensor nodes, so the design of efficient data collection protocols is a major concern. We address such high dynamic network and propose two mechanisms: prioritized-based contact-duration frame selection mechanism (PCdFS), and prioritized-based multiple contact-duration frame selection mechanisms (PMCdFS) to build collision-free scheduling and balance the nodes between the multi-UAV respectively. Based on the two mechanisms, we proposed a Balance algorithm to conduct the collision-free communication between the mobile nodes and the multi-UAVs. Two key design ideas for a Balance algorithm are: (a) no need of higher priority for those nodes that have lower transmission rate between them and the UAV and (b) improve the communication opportunity for those nodes that have shorter contact duration with the UAVs. We demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms through extensive simulations, and real experiments. These experiments using 15 mobile nodes at a path with 10 intersections and 1 island, present that network fairness is efficiently enhanced. We also confirm the applicability of proposed algorithms in a challenging and realistic scenario through numerous experiments on a path at Tongji campus in Shanghai, China.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christensen, Fin</author><author>Kientopf, Kai</author><author>Staudinger, Emanuel</author><author>Guenes, Mesut</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance of Routing Protocols over TDMA MAC for Robotic Swarms in Space Exploration</title><secondary-title>IEEE 95th Vehicular Technology Conference: (VTC-Spring)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2022 IEEE 95TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (VTC2022-SPRING)</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-66548-243-1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860797</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Future space exploration missions to celestial bodies will use a multitude of networked robots. This paper addresses the networking aspect and in particular the routing in such an ad hoc network during surface exploration. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) developed a wireless communication, localization, and timing system including a PHY and MAC for decentralized swarm communication. A decentralized routing protocol is required to realize multi-hop communication. Thus, the natural choice is an ad hoc network routing protocol. We introduce a simulation environment to study ad hoc network routing protocols for this application field. The network simulation provides a TDMA based MAC resembling DLR's system, an IEEE 802.11g MAC, and incorporates elevation data of the Moon's surface for realistic radio propagation modeling. Furthermore, we present and evaluate performance metrics relevant for planetary surface exploration.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2022 IEEE 95TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (VTC2022-SPRING)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Yidi</author><author>Liu, Hao</author><author>Guo, Jiapeng</author><author>Wang, Yujie</author><author>Liu, Fei</author><author>Ding, Shanshan</author><author>Chen, Renwen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cooperative Networking Strategy of UAV Cluster for Large-Scale WSNs</title><secondary-title>IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Sens.

As a critical component of an aviation swarm, airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communication capability. Considering the deficiencies of today's ATNs, it is unable to meet the communication demands of an aviation swarm, which motivates us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm and design a SDN-enabled airborne tactical network (SD-ATN). For the SDN paradigm, network monitoring information (M-info) is the source of knowledge that forms the globe network view of the control plane; therefore, how to ensure that the control plane collects M-info from the data plane in a reliable and real-time way is a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN. To address this issue, a transmission framework called the MCF-SD-ATN is first designed, which makes it practical to provide dedicated quality of service (QoS) guarantees for the M-info collection. Then, a communication protocol called the MCP-SD-ATN is designed to implement the M-info collection work based on the MCF-SD-ATN. We implement the MCF-SD-ATN and the MCP-SD-ATN in EXata 5.1 for simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is appropriate for M-info collection in the SD-ATN.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daely, Philip Tobianto</author><author>Anantha, Alifia Putri</author><author>Lee, Jae Min</author><author>Kim, Dong-Seong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distributed Computing Architecture for Logistic Job Allocation in Smart Factory</title><secondary-title>11th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC) - Data, Network, and AI in the Age of Untact (ICTC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ICT CONVERGENCE: DATA, NETWORK, AND AI IN THE AGE OF UNTACT (ICTC 2020)</full-title></periodical><pages>1845-1847</pages><keywords><keyword>edge computing</keyword><keyword>Vehicle Routing Problem</keyword><keyword>distributed computing</keyword><keyword>PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>automatic guided vehicle</keyword><keyword>job allocation</keyword><keyword>smart factory</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72816-758-9</isbn><abstract>This paper proposed an architecture that utilize edge servers to allocate logistic jobs to autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) in smart factory setting.

In a green network, energy saving of network nodes such as base stations (BSs), switches, and servers should be achieved efficiently. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous network architecture in 5G networks with separated data and control planes, where basically a macro cell manages control signals and a small cell manages data traffic. Then, we propose an optimized handover scheme based on context information such as reference signal received power, speed of user equipment (UE), traffic load, call admission control level, and data type. In this paper, the main objective of the proposed optimal handover is either to reduce the number of handovers or the total energy consumption of BSs. To this end, we develop optimization problems with either the minimization of the number of total handovers or the minimization of energy consumption of BSs as the objective function of the optimization problem. The solution of the optimization problem is obtained by particle swarm optimization, since the developed optimization problem is an NP hard problem. Performance analysis results via simulation based on various probability distributions of the characteristics of UE and BS show that the proposed optimized handover based on context information performs better than the previous call admission control based handover scheme, from the perspective of the number of handovers and total energy consumption. We also show that the proposed handover scheme can efficiently reduce either the number of handovers or the total energy consumption by applying either handover minimization or energy minimization depending on the objective of the application.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Jeong-Sik</author><author>Na, Hyeong-Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Front-End of Vehicle-Embedded Speech Recognition for Voice-Driven Multi-UAVs Control</title><secondary-title>APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL</full-title><abbr-1>Appl.

However, for stable voice-controlled driving, it is essential to handle the environmental conditions of UAVs carefully, including environmental noise that deteriorates recognition accuracy, and the operating scheme, e.g., how to direct a target vehicle among multiple UAVs and switch targets using speech commands. To handle these issues, we propose an efficient vehicle-embedded speech recognition front-end for multi-UAV control via voice. First, we propose a noise reduction approach that considers non-stationary noise in outdoor environments. The proposed method improves the conventional minimum mean squared error (MMSE) approach to handle non-stationary noises, e.g., babble and vehicle noises. In addition, we propose a multi-channel voice trigger method that can control multiple UAVs while efficiently directing and switching the target vehicle via speech commands. We evaluated the proposed methods on speech corpora, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the conventional approaches. In trigger word detection experiments, our approach yielded approximately 7%, 12%, and 3% relative improvements over spectral subtraction, adaptive comb filtering, and the conventional MMSE, respectively. In addition, the proposed multi-channel voice trigger approach achieved approximately 51% relative improvement over the conventional approach based on a single trigger word.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jian</author><author>Liu, Yongxin</author><author>Niu, Shuteng</author><author>Jing, Weipeng</author><author>Song, Houbing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Throughput Optimization in Heterogeneous Swarms of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for Advanced Aerial Mobility</title><secondary-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Trans.

The heterogeneous collaboration between UAS swarm enhances the complexity and the efficiency of mission complement that requires robustness, flexibility, and sustainability of throughput in UAS swarm networking. The conventional approaches mainly are based on the hierarchical architectures that are limited to satisfy the challenges of UAS swarm with high dynamics on a large scale. In this paper, we propose an optimal cell wall paradigm to enhance the throughput in heterogeneous UAS swarm networking. With the weight adjustment of each link, we map the optimization into a polyhedron scheduling problem and formula the problem into Max-min Throughput Fair Scheduling (MTFS). Further, we propose a max-min throughput algorithm to optimize the minimum throughput of cell wall paradigm. With the optimal max-min throughput, we optimize the schedule with edge-coloring to achieve global MTFS solving. The normalized MTFS shows our algorithm can achieve over 40% improvement of MTFS globally. In terms of MTFS solving, our algorithms have promising potential to improve the throughput and mitigate the incidents for multiple beams enabling of UAS in cell wall communication. With the throughput enhancement, the advanced aerial mobility of UAS swarm networking can be escalated on a large scale.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Durrani, Mehr Yahya</author><author>Tariq, Rehan</author><author>Aadil, Farhan</author><author>Maqsood, Muazzam</author><author>Nam, Yunyoung</author><author>Muhammad, Khan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptive Node Clustering Technique for Smart Ocean under Water Sensor Network (SOSNET)</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1145</pages><volume>19</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>optimization</keyword><keyword>clustering</keyword><keyword>routing</keyword><keyword>ALGORITHM</keyword><keyword>OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>ROUTING PROTOCOL</keyword><keyword>LIFETIME</keyword><keyword>moth flame optimizer</keyword><keyword>smart ocean</keyword><keyword>transmission range optimization</keyword><keyword>underwater communication and networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>MAR 1 2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s19051145</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Smart ocean is a term broadly used for monitoring the ocean surface, sea habitat monitoring, and mineral exploration to name a few. Development of an efficient routing protocol for smart oceans is a non-trivial task because of various challenges, such as presence of tidal waves, multiple sources of noise, high propagation delay, and low bandwidth. In this paper, we have proposed a routing protocol named adaptive node clustering technique for smart ocean underwater sensor network (SOSNET). SOSNET employs a moth flame optimizer (MFO) based technique for selecting a near optimal number of clusters required for routing. MFO is a bio inspired optimization technique, which takes into account the movement of moths towards light. The SOSNET algorithm is compared with other bio inspired algorithms such as comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), and gray wolf optimization (GWO). All these algorithms are used for routing optimization. The performance metrics used for this comparison are transmission range of nodes, node density, and grid size. These parameters are varied during the simulation, and the results indicate that SOSNET performed better than other algorithms.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gul, Faiza</author><author>Mir, Adnan</author><author>Mir, Imran</author><author>Mir, Suleman</author><author>Ul Islaam, Tauqeer</author><author>Abualigah, Laith</author><author>Forestiero, Agostino</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Centralized Strategy for Multi-Agent Exploration</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>126871-126884</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Artificial intelligence</keyword><keyword>Planning</keyword><keyword>Robot sensing systems</keyword><keyword>Path planning</keyword><keyword>Robotics</keyword><keyword>Collision avoidance</keyword><keyword>artificial intelligence</keyword><keyword>Autonomous systems</keyword><keyword>Multi-agent systems</keyword><keyword>Robot kinematics</keyword><keyword>space exploration</keyword><keyword>autonomous systems</keyword><keyword>ALGORITHM</keyword><keyword>PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>multiple agent system</keyword><keyword>optimization algorithms</keyword><keyword>COORDINATED MULTIROBOT EXPLORATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3218653</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper introduces recently developed Aquila Optimization Algorithm specifically configured for Multi-Robot space exploration. The proposed hybrid framework "Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration Aquila Optimizer " (CME-AO) is a unique combination of both deterministic Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration (CME) and a swarm based methodology, known as Aquila Optimizer (AO). A novel parallel communication protocol is also embedded to improve multi-robot space exploration process while simultaneously minimizing both the computation complexity and time. This ensures acquisition of a optimal collision-free path in a barrier-filled environment via generating a finite map. The architecture starts by determining the cost and utility values of neighbouring cells around the robot using deterministic CME. Aquila Optimization technique is then incorporated to increase the overall solution accuracy. Numerous simulations under different environmental conditions were then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Algorithm consistency aspects in achieving the expected results (area explored rate and time) is demonstrated through statistical means. A perspective analysis is then performed by comparing the performance of the CME-AO algorithm with latest state of art contemporary algorithms namely conventional CME and CME-WO (CME Whale Optimizer). The comparison duly accommodates all pertinent aspects such as % area explored, number of failed runs, and time taken for map exploration for different environments. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents two distinct advantages over the other conventional state of the art CME based techniques a) enhanced map exploration in cluttered environment and b) significantly reduced computation complexity and execution time, with almost no fail runs. This makes the suggested methodology particularly suitable for on-board utilization in an obstacle-cluttered environment, where other techniques either fails (stuck locally) or takes longer exploration time.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Shasha</author><author>Peng, Xinyu</author><author>Pang, Ruiqiu</author><author>Li, Li</author><author>Song, Zixuan</author><author>Ye, Hongying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Information Preference and Information Supply Efficiency Evaluation before, during, and after an Earthquake: Evidence from Songyuan, China</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

There is little information available in the literature regarding information preference from an individual's need perspective, and there is a lack of differentiation in evaluation between information need and supply. Under the guidance of the crisis stage analysis theory, using multiple response analysis and weighted analysis methods, this study explores earthquake disaster information content and communication channel preferences, and develops an information deviation index (IDI) to evaluate the efficiency of risk communication before, during, and after an earthquake. A questionnaire-based survey of 918 valid respondents in Songyuan, China, which had been hit by a small earthquake swarm, was conducted to provide practical evidence for this study. The results indicated the following. Firstly, the information needs of individuals are highly differentiated in the different stages of an earthquake. From pre-disaster to post-disaster, individuals show a shift in information need from "preparedness and response knowledge" to "disaster information", then to "disaster information and disaster relief information" in parallel, to "reconstruction and reflection information". Based on the above analysis, a composition of the main earthquake disaster information is proposed for different stages. Secondly, by measuring the values of the IDI, we found that most individuals' information needs were met for the earthquake. Thirdly, the TV and the internet were the two preferred commutation channels for acquiring disaster information from among all the effective channels in all the stages.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Qin</author><author>Parasuraman, Ramviyas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hierarchical Needs Based Self-Adaptive Framework For Cooperative Multi-Robot System</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)</full-title></periodical><pages>2991-2998</pages><keywords><keyword>ARCHITECTURE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72818-526-2</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/smc42975.2020.9283249</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research in multi-robot and swarm systems has seen significant interest in cooperation of agents in complex and dynamic environments. To effectively adapt to unknown environments and maximize the utility of the group, robots need to cooperate, share information, and make a suitable plan according to the specific scenario. Inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of human needs and systems theory, we introduce Robot's Need Hierarchy and propose a new solution called Self-Adaptive Swarm System (SASS). It combines multi-robot perception, communication, planning, and execution with the cooperative management of conflicts through a distributed Negotiation-Agreement Mechanism that prioritizes robot's needs. We also decompose the complex tasks into simple executable behaviors through several Atomic Operations, such as selection, formation, and routing. We evaluate SASS through simulating static and dynamic tasks and comparing them with the state-of-the-art collision-aware task assignment method integrated into our framework.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Shasha</author><author>Zhai, Guofang</author><author>Zhou, Shutian</author><author>Fan, Chenjing</author><author>Wu, Yunqing</author><author>Ren, Chongqiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insight into the Earthquake Risk Information Seeking Behavior of the Victims: Evidence from Songyuan, China</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

Efficient risk communication aims at improving the supply of risk information and fulfilling the need for risk information by individuals. Therefore, an investigation into individual-level information seeking behavior within earthquake risk contexts is very important for improved earthquake risk communication. However, at present there are very few studies that have explored the behavior of individuals seeking earthquake risk information. Under the guidance of the Risk Information Seeking and Processing model as well as relevant practical findings using the structural equation model, this study attempts to explore the main determinants of an individual's earthquake risk information seeking behavior, and to validate the mediator effect of information need during the seeking process. A questionnaire-based survey of 918 valid respondents in Songyuan, China, who had been hit by a small earthquake swarm, was used to provide practical evidence for this study. Results indicated that information need played a noteworthy role in the earthquake risk information seeking process, and was detected both as an immediate predictor and as a mediator. Informational subjective norms drive the seeking behavior on earthquake risk information through both direct and indirect approaches. Perceived information gathering capacity, negative affective responses and risk perception have an indirect effect on earthquake risk information seeking behavior via information need. The implications for theory and practice regarding risk communication are discussed and concluded.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ahn, Misun</author><author>Lee, Sungwon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Research on VNF-enabled Radio Access Network for UDN using Low-cost Compute Node</title><secondary-title>2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ICT CONVERGENCE (ICTC)</full-title></periodical><pages>846-848</pages><keywords><keyword>WLAN</keyword><keyword>Docker Swarm</keyword><keyword>UDN</keyword><keyword>VNF</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4673-7116-2</isbn><abstract>The Network architecture using the deployment of VNF (Virtual Network Function) based on NFV(Network Functions Virtualization) enables to provide fast service to the user, since it has flexible structure in mobile traffic.

In many situations, stand-off remote-sensing and hazard-interdiction techniques over realistic operational areas are often impractical and difficult to characterize. An alternative approach is to implement adaptive remote-sensing techniques with swarms of mobile agents employing collective behavior for optimization of mapping signatures and positional orientation (registration). We have expanded intelligent control theory using physics-based collective behavior models and genetic algorithms to produce a uniquely powerful implementation of distributed ground-based measurement incorporating both local collective behavior, and inter-operative global optimization far sensor fusion and mission oversight. By using a layered hierarchical control architecture to orchestrate adaptive reconfiguration of semiautonomous robotic agents, we can improve overall robustness and functionality in dynamic tactical environments without information bottlenecking. In our concept, each sensor is equipped with a miniaturized optical reflectance modulator which is interactively monitored as a remote transponder using a laser communication protocol from a remote mothership or operative. Robot data-sharing at the ground level can be leveraged with global evaluation criteria, including terrain overlays and remote imaging data. Information sharing and distributed intelligence opens up a new class of remote sensing applications in which small single-function autonomous observers at the local level can collectively optimize and measure large scale ground-level signatures. As the need for coverage and the number of agents grows to improve spatial resolution, cooperative behavior orchestrated by a global situational awareness umbrella will be an essential ingredient to offset increasing bandwidth requirements within the net. A system of this type is being developed which will be capable of sensitively detecting, tracking, and mapping spatial distributions of measurement signatures, which are nonstationary or obscured by clutter or interfering obstacles by virtue of adaptive reconfiguration This methodology is being used to field an, adaptive ground-penetrating impulse radar from a superposition of small radiating dipoles for detection of underground structures and to detect/remediate hazardous biological or chemical species in migrating plumes.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Bellingham</custom1><custom3>UNATTENDED GROUND SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aadil, Farhan</author><author>Song, Oh-young</author><author>Mushtaq, Mahreen</author><author>Maqsood, Muazzam</author><author>Sheikh, Sadia Ejaz</author><author>Baber, Junaid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An efficient cluster optimization framework for internet of things (IoT) based Wireless Body Area Networks</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Sensors deployed in WBANs have restricted resources such as battery energy, computing power and bandwidth. We can utilize these resources efficiently. By devising a mechanism that is energy efficient with following characteristics, i.e. computational complexity is less, routing overhead is minimized, and throughput will be maximum. A lot of work has been done in this area but still WBAN faces some challenges like mobility, network lifetime, transmission range, heterogeneous environment, and limited resources. In the present years well, contemplative studies have been made through a large body to reach some holistic points pertaining to the energy consumption in WBAN. Thus we/put forward appropriate algorithm for energy efficiency which can vividly corroborate the advances in this specific domain. We have also focused on various aspects and phases of the studies like study computational complexity, routing overhead and throughput type of characteristics. There is still a room for improvement to get the desired energy optimization in WBAN. The network performance mainly relies upon the algorithm used for optimization process. In this work, we intended to develop an energy optimization algorithm for energy consumption in WBAN which is based on evolutionary algorithms for inter-BAN communications using cluster-based routing protocol. Design/methodology/approach In this paper we propose a meta heuristics algorithm Goa to solve the optimization problem in WBAN. Grasshopper is an insect. Generally, this insect is viewed individually and creating large swarm in nature. Figure 5 shows the individual grasshoppers' primitive patterns in swarm. Figure 7 depicts the pseudo code of Goa. In Goa, experiments are done to view the behavior of grasshoppers in swarm. How they gradually move towards the stationary and mobile target. Through experimentation it is conceived that swarm gradually converge towards their target. Another interesting pattern related to convergence of grasshopper is that it slowly towards its target. This shows that grasshopper does not trapped in local optima. In starting iterations of exploration process Goa, search globally and in last iterations it searches local optima. Goa makes the exploration and exploitation process balanced while solving challenging optimization problems. Findings Energy efficiency is achieved in the optimization process of cluster formation process. As the use of proposed algorithm Goa creates the optimal number of clusters. Shorter cluster lifetime means more times clustering procedure is called. It increases the network computational cost and the communication overhead. Experimentation results show that proposed Goa algorithm performs well. We compare the results of Goa with existing optimization Algorithms ACO and MFO. Results are generated using MATLAB. Originality/value A lot of work has done for the sake of energy optimization in WBAN. Many algorithms are proposed in past for energy optimization of WBAN. All of them have some strengths and weaknesses. In this paper we propose a nature inspired algorithm Goa. We use the Goa algorithm for the sake of energy optimization in WBAN.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raza, Syed M.</author><author>Jeong, Jaeyeop</author><author>Kim, Moonseong</author><author>Kang, Byungseok</author><author>Choo, Hyunseung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Empirical Performance and Energy Consumption Evaluation of Container Solutions on Resource Constrained IoT Gateways</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1378</pages><volume>21</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Internet of Things</keyword><keyword>energy consumption</keyword><keyword>containers</keyword><keyword>docker swarm</keyword><keyword>empirical analysis</keyword><keyword>kubernetes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>FEB 2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s21041378</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Containers virtually package a piece of software and share the host Operating System (OS) upon deployment. This makes them notably light weight and suitable for dynamic service deployment at the network edge and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for reduced latency and energy consumption. Data collection, computation, and now intelligence is included in variety of IoT devices which have very tight latency and energy consumption conditions. Recent studies satisfy latency condition through containerized services deployment on IoT devices and gateways. They fail to account for the limited energy and computing resources of these devices which limit the scalability and concurrent services deployment. This paper aims to establish guidelines and identify critical factors for containerized services deployment on resource constrained IoT devices. For this purpose, two container orchestration tools (i.e., Docker Swarm and Kubernetes) are tested and compared on a baseline IoT gateways testbed. Experiments use Deep Learning driven data analytics and Intrusion Detection System services, and evaluate the time it takes to prepare and deploy a container (creation time), Central Processing Unit (CPU) utilization for concurrent containers deployment, memory usage under different traffic loads, and energy consumption. The results indicate that container creation time and memory usage are decisive factors for containerized micro service architecture.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Farhad, Arshad</author><author>Kim, Dae-Ho</author><author>Pyun, Jae-Young</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scalability of LoRaWAN in an Urban Environment: A Simulation Study</title><secondary-title>11th International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS AND FUTURE NETWORKS (ICUFN 2019)</full-title></periodical><pages>677-681</pages><keywords><keyword>Internet of Things</keyword><keyword>LoRaWAN</keyword><keyword>capacity</keyword><keyword>scalability</keyword><keyword>spreading factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72811-339-5</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/icufn.2019.8806140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) communication protocol can be adapted for the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its long geographical coverage, low energy consumption, high capacity, open business model, and low cost. Recently, both academia and industry are attracted to LoRaWAN because of its recent developments and applicability in the IoT environment. Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio. We also observed that the use of acknowledgment limits the scalability of the LoRaWAN due to the duty cycle constraints.

The open deployment, energy constraint, and lack of centralized administration makes WSN very vulnerable to various kinds of malicious attacks. In WSN, identifying malicious sensor device and eliminating their sensed information play very important roles for mission critical applications. Standard cryptography and authentication schemes cannot be directly used in WSN because of the resource constraint nature of sensor devices. Thus, energy efficient and low latency methodology is required for minimizing the impact of malicious sensor devices. This paper presents a secure and load balanced routing (SLBR) scheme for heterogeneous clustered-based WSN. SLBR present better trust-based security metric that overcomes the problem when sensor keep oscillating for good to bad state and vice versa, and also balance load among CH. Thus, they aid in achieving better security, packet transmission, and energy efficiency performance. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed SLBR model over existing trust-based routing model, namely exponential cat swarm optimization (ECSO). The result attained shows SLBR models attain better performance than ECSO in terms of energy efficiency (i.e., network lifetime considering first sensor device death and total sensor device death), communication overhead, throughput, packet processing latency, malicious sensor device misclassification rate, and identification.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gul, Malik Ali</author><author>Yousaf, Muhammad Haroon</author><author>Nawaz, Shah</author><author>Ur Rehman, Zaka</author><author>Kim, HyungWon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Patient Monitoring by Abnormal Human Activity Recognition Based on CNN Architecture</title><secondary-title>ELECTRONICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ELECTRONICS</full-title><abbr-1>Electronics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1993</pages><volume>9</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>deep learning</keyword><keyword>YOLO</keyword><keyword>abnormal human activity</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>DEC 2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2079-9292</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/electronics9121993</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Human action recognition has emerged as a challenging research domain for video understanding and analysis. Subsequently, extensive research has been conducted to achieve the improved performance for recognition of human actions. Human activity recognition has various real time applications, such as patient monitoring in which patients are being monitored among a group of normal people and then identified based on their abnormal activities. Our goal is to render a multi class abnormal action detection in individuals as well as in groups from video sequences to differentiate multiple abnormal human actions. In this paper, You Look only Once (YOLO) network is utilized as a backbone CNN model. For training the CNN model, we constructed a large dataset of patient videos by labeling each frame with a set of patient actions and the patient's positions. We retrained the back-bone CNN model with 23,040 labeled images of patient's actions for 32 epochs. Across each frame, the proposed model allocated a unique confidence score and action label for video sequences by finding the recurrent action label. The present study shows that the accuracy of abnormal action recognition is 96.8%. Our proposed approach differentiated abnormal actions with improved F1-Score of 89.2% which is higher than state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the proposed framework can be beneficial to hospitals and elder care homes for patient monitoring.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giordano, Pietro</author><author>Zoccarato, Paolo</author><author>Otten, Michiel</author><author>Crisci, Massimo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>P2OD: Real-time Precise Onboard Orbit Determination for LEO satellites</title><secondary-title>30th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS+)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 30TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS+ 2017)</full-title></periodical><pages>1754-1771</pages><keywords><keyword>GPS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Inst Navigation</publisher><abstract>Satellite orbit determination is a fundamental information for many space missions, several requiring a high level of orbit accuracy. Nowadays the Precise Orbit Determination ( POD) is the technique routinely used on ground for computing the orbit of LEO missions, especially when the position of the satellite center of mass has to be known at cm level ( e.g.: GRAS, Sentinels, SWARM, GOCE, etc.). The current POD approach must be performed only on ground in post-processing. The orbit accuracy achieved with the POD is typically between 0.1 mm/s to 1 mm/s for the velocity. Despite being in line with mission needs, the post-processing limitation is preventing its use for more advanced applications that require high accuracy in real-time, such as formation flying, autonomous docking and rendezvous, increased spacecraft autonomy, etc. This contribution investigates how to overcome the real-time limitations and shows that real-time Precise Onboard Orbit Determination ( P2OD) could be achieved in the near future, bringing the current ground PPP ( Precise Point Positioning) and PPP-RTK ( Precise Point Positioning - Real Time Kinematic) concept to space users. The target real-time orbit accuracy to be achieved with this approach is 10 cm RMS 3D ( 1 mm/s for velocity). Different algorithms have already been developed for onboard orbit determination, ranging from a least square approach to Extended or Unscented Kalman Filtering ( EKF, UKF). Usually the initial position is provided through a Single Point Positioning ( SPP) technique, using only the pseudorange measurements. The SPP solution can be smoothed by fitting a dynamic model. These onboard algorithms allow to reach an orbital velocity accuracy ( 3D RMS) at m/s or cm/s level ([ 23], [ 24], [ 25], [ 26] and [ 27]). Several studies ([ 28], [ 29] and [ 30]) have also investigated the optimization of the force models acting on the satellites and the related parameters for propagating the orbit with the electronics onboard a LEO satellite. The main limitation for such onboard OD algorithms is the lack of precise ephemeris and clock products for the GNSS satellites in real-time. GNSS receivers in space can use techniques and concepts adoptable by GNSS receiver on ground. There are at least two main concepts for real-time high accuracy positioning computation based on GNSS: RTK and PPP. RTK relies on use of ground stations in the proximity of the user receiver, therefore cannot be considered viable from space users. PPP ( and its evolution, the PPP-RTK) is based on the broadcast of precise corrections ( mainly precise orbits and clocks, but also a precise ionospheric model and, for PPP-RTK, delta phase correction for performing Integer Ambiguity Resolution on the rover) through different communication channels ( e.g., via geostationary satellites, GSM, Internet). This study addresses two main types of communication channels for providing precise orbit and clock corrections of the GNSS satellites: the dedicated broadcast and the global broadcast channels. The dedicated broadcast channel assumes that each GNSS satellite ( e.g.: GPS or Galileo) broadcasts its own precise corrections for orbits and clocks. Such a condition could be achieved with an improvement of the current broadcasted ephemerides and clocks ( via standard navigation message) or via a dedicated communication channel provided by the GNSS satellites that goes on top of the broadcasted navigation message. In this scenario the available bandwidth is normally limited, so the amount of corrections that can be disseminated is limited ( allowing to transmit only the corrections for the satellite itself or a small group of nearby satellites) and there is a need for a constant communication contact from the uplink stations to all or a high number of the GNSS satellites. Modern GNSS systems are very close to provide the infrastructure to enable the dedicated broadcast scheme and the present study aims to propose potential strategies to overcome the current limitations. The global broadcast channel relies on geostationary satellites for disseminating the precise corrections for all the GNSS satellites at the same time. Two major cases are considered: SBAS and commercial PPP providers. SBAS is planned to achieve worldwide coverage by 2020, but the dissemination of precise corrections to achieve cm level accuracy is today outside the scope of such systems, mainly because providing the integrity for such an accuracy might be not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, a new service providing high accuracy corrections ( initially without integrity) could be implemented using a potentially available spare bandwidth in the SBAS. Nowadays, commercial geostationary satellites are the only way to achieve the dissemination of precise corrections,, using commercial PPP service providers that currently cover the entire globe. This work will analyze the implications of using such communication channels on the space receiver architecture. The adopted solution will be suitable for different types of 24h 3-axis stabilized LEO spacecraft, from nano-satellites to large Earth-observing satellites. A novel concept based on the use of multi-antennas will be proposed to overcome the weak communication links above the poles for receiving the corrections from geostationary satellites. The real-time precise orbit determination will be sequentially computed with an EKF-based OD algorithm. The approach will be validated using real data from flying missions. Finally, a potential roadmap for In-Orbit Demonstration ( IOD) will be presented.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>Washington</custom1><custom3>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 30TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS+ 2017)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thahniyath, Gousia</author><author>Jayaprasad, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Secure and load balanced routing model for wireless sensor networks</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES</full-title><abbr-1>J.

However, the current domestic sewage discharge monitoring system is not perfect, resulting in the lack of effective monitoring of enterprise sewage discharge by regulatory authorities, which provides an opportunity for enterprises to steal discharge. In the background of sewage treatment plant, the comprehensive design of sewage monitoring and alarm system is carried out based on the idea of physical information fusion. The design adopts a four-layer information physical architecture, which is divided into four parts: perception communication, fusion processing, push, and execution. In the fusion treatment part, the neural network intelligent algorithm is used to predict the dissolved oxygen, and the oxygen delivery is adjusted according to the predicted value to achieve accurate aeration and optimize the effluent quality. The push and execution parts adopt multiparameter monitoring to realize the smooth operation of equipment and ensure the system security. A new optimal control strategy of dissolved oxygen based on neural network is proposed. Through a large number of experiments and historical data, the intake index and dissolved oxygen value of the aeration tank under the condition of optimal outlet water are obtained as samples. According to the sample training, the BP neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to achieve accurate prediction of dissolved oxygen under different inlet water conditions. The smooth operation of sewage treatment equipment is accomplished by the lower machine and the upper machine. In sewage treatment, each process section collects the equipment status in strict accordance with the order of sewage monitoring facilities. Then the communication network between the upper computer and the lower computer and the sensor is designed. The lower machine adopts PLC as the core, programming PLC through STEP7, and uses PID algorithm to control dissolved oxygen. The PC is developed in C language, so as to realize user login, real-time data display, over-limit fault alarm, report query, user management, etc. The PC integrates MATLAB neural network on the platform to predict dissolved oxygen through mixed programming quantity. The sewage alarm system based on improved artificial neural network is sensitive and has excellent performance. It provides a new idea for intelligent sewage detection and real-time monitoring.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Sanghyun</author><author>Lee, Joohyung</author><author>Park, Hong-Shik</author><author>Choi, Jun Kyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Novel Fair and Scalable Relay Control Scheme for Internet of Things in LoRa-Based Low-Power Wide-Area Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Internet Things J.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5985-6001</pages><volume>8</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Genetic algorithms</keyword><keyword>Internet of Things</keyword><keyword>Internet of Things (IoT)</keyword><keyword>genetic algorithm</keyword><keyword>Scalability</keyword><keyword>Signal to noise ratio</keyword><keyword>Relays</keyword><keyword>ALLOCATION</keyword><keyword>Interference</keyword><keyword>long range (LoRa)</keyword><keyword>Chirp</keyword><keyword>Cooperative relay</keyword><keyword>interference analysis</keyword><keyword>low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs)</keyword><keyword>pure ALOHA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>APR 1 2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2327-4662</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/JIOT.2020.3034185</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article proposes a novel fair and scalable relay control (FSRC) scheme for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) services in long range (LoRa)-based low-power wide-area networks. The proposed FSRC scheme promotes relay operation with low spreading factor (SF) to improve the success probability for distant end-devices (EDs) and the fairness of success probability for each SF region. To achieve this, a theoretical framework for designing the relay operation is analytically developed by considering a practical LoRaWAN MAC protocol as an analytical model. The proposed FSRC scheme encompasses a selective relay operation by considering both signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio and the receive signal strength indicator value for the location-unaware relay selection strategy. Using this model, a genetic algorithm-based relay control strategy is proposed to maximize both coverage probability and minimum success probability for all SF regions by controlling the relay parameters, such as source-relay region and source-relay ratio. Our numerical analysis validates the effectiveness of the proposed FSRC scheme under various parameters in terms of the minimum success probability of each SF region, coverage probability, and fairness. Specifically, we verify that the proposed FSRC scheme achieves a maximum of approximately 37% and 33% improvement of the minimum success probability and coverage probability, respectively, under practical LoRa PHY/MAC parameters, compared to the single-hop environment (without relay operation).</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Hyungwoo</author><author>Kim, Taehwa</author><author>Park, Hong-Shik</author><author>Choi, Jun Kyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Cooperative Online Learning-Based Load Balancing Scheme for Maximizing QoS Satisfaction in Dense HetNets</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>92345-92357</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Delays</keyword><keyword>Throughput</keyword><keyword>QoS</keyword><keyword>load balancing</keyword><keyword>ALGORITHM</keyword><keyword>Microprocessors</keyword><keyword>Load management</keyword><keyword>cell range expansion</keyword><keyword>cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Hetnets</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3089782</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper proposes a cooperative multi-agent online reinforcement learning-based (COMORL) bias offset (BO) control scheme for cell range expansion (CRE) in dense heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The proposed COMORL scheme controls BOs for CRE to maximize the number of user equipments (UEs) that satisfy their quality of service (QoS) requirements, especially in terms of delay and data rates. For this purpose, we developed a QoS satisfaction indicator that measures a violation of delay requirements by considering both QoS requirements and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In addition, we formulated a Markov decision process (MDP) model that is solved with a cooperative multi-agent online reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed COMORL scheme maximizes the global utility for load-coupled base stations. Our simulation results verify the proposed COMORL scheme's effectiveness in terms of throughput, delay satisfaction ratio, and fairness. Specifically, we verify that the proposed COMORL scheme achieves a maximum of approximately 27% and 30% improvement of the delay satisfaction ratio, which is how many UEs satisfy their delay requirement among all of the UEs in a serving BS under medium and full traffic loads, respectively, in a dynamic scenario in comparison to the max-SINR scheme.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashiquzzaman, Akm</author><author>Linh, Van Ma</author><author>Kim, SangWoo</author><author>Lee, Dongsu</author><author>Um, Tai-Won</author><author>Kim, Jinsul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Compacting Deep Neural Networks for Light Weight IoT &amp; SCADA Based Applications with Node Pruning</title><secondary-title>1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication (ICAIIC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (ICAIIC 2019)</full-title></periodical><pages>82-85</pages><keywords><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Deep learning</keyword><keyword>Convolutional Neural Network</keyword><keyword>Handwritten Digit recognition</keyword><keyword>Neural Network Pruning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-5386-7822-0</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/icaiic.2019.8669031</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Deeplearning based image classifier is getting improved day by day. The network architecture is also increasing with the accuracy. But the bigger size and resource intensive training makes this model impractical to deploy in IoT based computational units. IoT has limited resources and reckoning power. So smaller network with same accuracy is highly priced for IoT based application deployment. In this study, convolutional deeplearning neural network and how pruning filters without compromising accuracy was studied. Efficient result was achieved from the pruned deeplearning neural network. the model was configured in the experiments by pruning the filter based on absolution position of zeros value based filter ranking. SCADA applications with intelligent component to detect data abnormality and remote sensing also required neural network applications. Using compact memory efficient module in such machines will also give proper validation in such applications in real time. In the end, proposed method for the pruned network delivered same accuracy with reduced size and thus archiving memory and computation for small sized application.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2019 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (ICAIIC 2019)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tama, Bayu Adhi</author><author>Im, Sun</author><author>Lee, Seungchul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving an Intelligent Detection System for Coronary Heart Disease Using a Two-Tier Classifier Ensemble</title><secondary-title>BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL</full-title><abbr-1>Biomed Res.

It is the most frequent cause of mortality across the globe due to the lack of a healthy lifestyle. Owing to the fact that a heart attack occurs without any apparent symptoms, an intelligent detection method is inescapable. In this article, a new CHD detection method based on a machine learning technique, e.g., classifier ensembles, is dealt with. A two-tier ensemble is built, where some ensemble classifiers are exploited as base classifiers of another ensemble. A stacked architecture is designed to blend the class label prediction of three ensemble learners, i.e., random forest, gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting. The detection model is evaluated on multiple heart disease datasets, i.e., Z-Alizadeh Sani, Statlog, Cleveland, and Hungarian, corroborating the generalisability of the proposed model. A particle swarm optimization-based feature selection is carried out to choose the most significant feature set for each dataset. Finally, a two-fold statistical test is adopted to justify the hypothesis, demonstrating that the performance differences of classifiers do not rely upon an assumption. Our proposed method outperforms any base classifiers in the ensemble with respect to 10-fold cross validation. Our detection model has performed better than current existing models based on traditional classifier ensembles and individual classifiers in terms of accuracy, F1, and AUC.

In particular, LiDAR is widely used in mobile mapping systems (MMS) for building high -definition (HD) map. Not only range but also intensity are useful data for extracting road marking and surface data from sensor. However, LiDAR intensity is affected by surface reflecting characteristic as well as range, incidence angle, atmospheric transmittance and others. Therefore, LiDAR intensity model is difficult to reproduce in simulation environments. In this paper, we proposed realistic intensity rendering method with simulator by generative adversarial network (GAN) trained with unannotated real data. We develop LiDAR projection preprocessing method for operating convolution networks. Our approach have advantage to preserve sensor characteristic and to reduce projection scale loss. We modified CycleGAN architecture to render intensity with unpaired real and synthetic data. Our rendered results show possibility of image-based approach for LiDAR and potential for generating LiDAR dataset by using simulator. Especially, we expect to utilize for military vehicle that has difficulty to reproduce the environments.</abstract><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND SMART COMPUTING (BIGCOMP 2021)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aminanto, Muhamad Erza</author><author>Choi, Rakyong</author><author>Tanuwidjaja, Harry Chandra</author><author>Yoo, Paul D.</author><author>Kim, Kwangjo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep Abstraction and Weighted Feature Selection for Wi-Fi Impersonation Detection</title><secondary-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Trans.

The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.</abstract><language>English</language></record></records></xml>
