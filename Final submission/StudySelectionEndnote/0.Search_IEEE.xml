Since the GCS belongs to the central control architecture, the edge computing system of the distributed architecture gives the drones more flexibility in dealing with changing environmental conditions, allowing them to autonomously and instantly plan their flight path, fly in formation, or even avoid obstacles. Broadcast communications are used to realize UAV-to-UAV communications for allocating tasks among a swarm of UAVs and ensuring each individual collaborates as an integrated member of the group. The dynamic path programming problem for the UAV swarm mission uses a 2-phase Tabu search with the 2-Opt exchange method and A* search as the path programming algorithm. Distance is taken as a cost function for path programming. We then increase and expand the turning-points of no-fly zones based on drone fleet coverage, thus preventing drones from entering prohibited areas. Whereas previous work mostly only considers single no-fly zones, this approach accounts for multiple restricted areas, ensuring that a UAV swarm can complete its assigned task without violating no-fly zones. A drone encountering an obstacle while traveling along the route set by the algorithm will update the map information in real-time, allowing for an instant recharting of the optimal path to the goal as a reverse search using the D* Lite algorithm.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE 3rd Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

The FANET task allocation problem is one-to-one assignment of agents to tasks so that the overall benefit of all the agents is maximized by taking delays and costs into account, given a set of agents and a set of tasks. A coordination based task allocation system ensuring spatial and temporal coordination between UAVs is essential for FANETs. In this paper, a new multi UAV task planning heuristic is proposed for FANETs to visit all target points in a minimum time, while preserving all time network connectivity.

UAVs may also be used as mobile aerial Base Station (BS) for maintaining the communication in emergency scenarios. The millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, including the sub-THz frequencies above 100 GHz, are an attractive technology for high data rate UAV connectivity due to the wide bandwidths available at these frequencies. This paper studies antenna and codebook design for UAV communication at both 28 and 140 GHz with realistic antenna simulations and flight patterns. The analysis shows that multi-array configurations with proper codebook design are necessary for uniform spherical coverage and become particularly important in long range applications. The paper thus proposes a four array design with patch antennas. Simulations indicate that the design can achieve in excess of 1 Gbps data rates at a range of 1 km, with reasonable power levels and moderate rain fades. A simulation with a real public safety mission flight shows that beam tracking can be maintained even under high drone movements and rotations.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.

This is trending in different satellite industry applications such as Earth observation and satellite communication as it is simple, cheap and increases the system robustness. Multi-satellite missions introduced different lines of development like constellations, trail formation and swarm formations to fit different type of missions requirements. Inspired by the Space Ultra-Low Frequency Radio Observatory (SULFRO) project, based on the concept of a constellation of a micro-satellite mothership and 12 nano-satellite daughters, designed for sky observation and space discovery, in this paper, we propose a model of decentralized swarm formation without using a centralized coordination. The proposed method is based on the assumption that micro-satellite share relative position of the formation and communicate through high speed inter-satellite link. Assuming a 2D space for the micro-satellite formation and deployment, the proposed methodology succeeded to deploy the 12 micro-satellites in their targeted formation. The proposed methodology consists of three states that are: Formation Tracking, Movement Control and Collision Avoidance. These three states contributed in the success of the methodology by ensuring that the micro-satellite share the positions and track the new formation needed to ensure the stability and safety of the micro-satellite swarm. The paper also investigated the power consumption of the system and the system stability. The proposed methodology is simulated in three different validation scenarios and successfully achieved the required formation.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE International Symposium on Robotic and Sensors Environments (ROSE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The main drawback of naturally inspired strategies, such as Levy flight, is the agents' poor coordination and redundant search (continuous exploration of single location within minimum time and space). The redundant search was removed by assigning probability values to cells and subjecting agents' waypoints acceptance to distance and time threshold. The proposed algorithm ensures broad coverage, minimised redundant search, scalability, and adaptable swarm coordination. The benefits of the algorithm were evaluated on the simulation of the Nigerian telecommunication masts surveillance mission using a proposed architecture.

Though individual UAVs are extremely useful entities, their productivity can further be increased by deploying multi-UAVs. Pattern formation among multi-UAVs is one of the key functionalities in a swarm environment that is essential for several UAV missions namely military expedition, search and rescue operations, drone based delivery mechanisms etc. In this paper, to facilitate pattern formation among UAVs in an effective manner, a Time-Interleaved Pattern Formation (TIPF) Mechanism is proposed. The existing systems work for a fixed number of drones whose pattern switching mechanisms are preprogrammed. However, the TIPF mechanism enables switching patterns among dynamic number of drones (UAVs) on the fly by inducing a small delay between each UAV movement. The TIPF mechanism avoids collision, which occurs due to the simultaneous movement of UAVs. The proposed TIPF mechanism encompasses a Centralised Coordinate Calculation (CCC) algorithm to easily calculate the coordinates of UAVs in a given pattern. Further, this mechanism has also been simulated and tested in our proposed virtual IP based Software In The Loop (V-SITL) environment. This proposed V-SITL environment offers increased scalability on account of the entire UAV system being simulated in a single computer. The TIPF mechanism has been simulated for 8 drones in a dynamic manner for square and triangle patterns. The simulation results show that the pattern formation time avoids collision in a time interleaving rate of 52.63%.</abstract><custom3>GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D. -Y.

In particular, with a limited number of UAVs, it is important to determine both mission assignment of UAVs to enhance mission performance and locations of UAVs to maintain good communication with the ground control station (GCS). In this paper, we study a problem of joint mission assignment and location management for UAVs, with jointly considering communication and mission performance. To solve the problem, employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in part, we develop an heuristic algorithm that assigns multiple UAVs to multiple missions and finds locations of all UAVs together to maximize the weighted sum of the communication and mission performance.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. In this talk an introduction to unmanned aerial vehicles will be made, detailing their operation, main uses, and main research challenges. Next, different applications and systems developed in our research group will be discussed, showing how wireless communications can be used to achieve advanced features such as swarm creation and collision avoidance.Regarding collision avoidance, the Mission Based Collision Avoidance Protocol (MBCAP) is presented. MBCAP is a novel UAV collision avoidance protocol applicable to all types of multicopters flying autonomously. It relies on wireless communications in order to detect nearby UAVs, and to negotiate the procedure to avoid any potential collision. Experiments show that MBCAP is very effective at impeding collisions, while introducing a flight time overhead that is typically in the range from 15 to 40 seconds.Concerning swarm creation, the Mission-based UAV Swarm Coordination Protocol (MUSCOP) is presented. It allows multiple UAVs to perfectly coordinate their flight when performing planned missions. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is able to achieve a high degree of swarm cohesion independently of the swarm formation adopted, being resilient to channel losses, and introducing a low synchronization time overhead.</abstract><custom3>2020 Second International Conference on Embedded &amp; Distributed Systems (EDiS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Within this field, solutions where several UAVs team-up to create a swarm are gaining momentum as they enable to perform more sophisticated tasks, or accelerate task execution compared to the single-UAV alternative. However, advanced solutions based on UAV swarms still lack significant advancements and validation in real environments to facilitate their adoption and deployment. In this paper we take a step ahead in this direction by proposing a solution that improves the resilience of swarm flights, focusing on handling the loss of the swarm leader, which is typically the most critical condition to be faced. Experiments using our UAV emulation tool (ArduSim) evidence the correctness of the protocol under adverse circumstances, and highlight that swarm members are able to seamlessly switch to an alternative leader when necessary, introducing a negligible delay in the process in most cases, while keeping this delay within a few seconds even in worst-case conditions.</abstract><custom3>2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V. -A.

Having meshed interconnection, a swarm maintains a communication network dedicated for applications with context-dependent performance requirements that require reliable traffic classification and conditioning. Nevertheless, these systems are vulnerable because UAVs/UGVs may act incorrectly resulting in an erroneous network behavior which may affect the performance of mission-critical flows. This is a major problem if a couple of untrusted UAVs and UGVs from different rescue organizations are connected. In this paper, the reliability of traffic conditioning within untrusted swarms is enhanced by the Distributed Flow Permission Inspection (DiFPIN) scheme. DiFPIN is used to verify the flow classification to circumvent the usage of erroneous entities on the transmission path. Thereby, the negative impairment of mission-critical flows can be reduced.</abstract><custom3>2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

The use of a group of UAVs instead of one single UAV offers many advantages like extending the mission coverage, providing a reliable ad-hoc networks services, and enhancing the service performance, to name a few. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of the swarm topology, the coordination of a large number of UAVs poses new challenges to traditional inter-UAV communication protocols. Therefore, there is a need for the design of new networking protocols that can efficiently support the fast-pace and real-time requirements of a coordinated swarm navigation in various environments. In this paper, we propose SEMRP a Swarm energy-efficient multicast routing protocol for UAVs flying in group formations. The main purpose of SEMRP is to facilitate the control and information delivery between UAVs while minimizing inter-UAV packet loss, packet re-transmission, and end-to-end delay. In this study we show how SEMRP achieves these objectives by taking into account various Quality-of-Service parameters like the network throughput, the UAVs mobility, and energy efficiency to ensure a timely and accurate information delivery to all members of a UAV swarm. The results of the conducted simulation using NS-2 advocate for the efficiency of our proposal through its to two presented versions (SEMRP-v1 and SEMRP-v2) in term of reducing the total emission energy (at least by 10 dBm), optimizing the End-to-End Delay by 44%, and increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Intelligent swarm systems are very efficient at solving group-level problems and their capability to accomplish complex missions with no or little human intervention. One of the most challenging problems is operating in environments with surrounding obstacles such as buildings, thus, often obstructing inter-UAV communication. A UAV swarm is required to maintain continuous communication between its members and preserve the stability of its formation while flying towards an ultimate goal. In this paper we propose MSCS, a new cooperative and adaptive scheme for multi-clustered autonomous UAV swarms. This schemes allows several UAVs operating in a swarm formation to coordinate their navigation and path planning operations by using an adaptive multi-clustered leader-follower approach. The swarm members follow a dynamically elected leader based on the UAV with best fit to lead the swarm towards the destination. The coordination of the UAVs is achieved through SBP (Swarm Broadcast Protocol), a single-hop broadcast UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication protocol, which allows swarm members to exchange information about their current location and their local cluster leader.

How to do rescue mission planning for UAV swarms underlimited communication has become a difficult problem. This paperproposes a motif-based mission planning model which generates amission planning strategy as a task priority execution order isinputted. The choice of mission planning strategy turns to be thechoice of a task priority execution order which is a many-objectiveoptimization problem. Permutation and combination of task priorityexecution order contribute to the generation of mass feasible task planningstrategies. The increase in the number of tasks leads to the explosionof the amount of calculation. We enhance preference-inspiredco-evolutionary algorithm with goal vectors (PICEA-g) by usingthe K-means clustering method in the step of offspring selection to selectout next-generation goal vectors. The proposed algorithm, calledk-PICEA-g is applied in the optimization processminimizing, simultaneously, the mission completion time, the total number of changed connections, and the averagenumber of used UAVs through changing the priority execution order oftasks. As an example of application, we apply the improvedPICEA-g to optimize the execution order of a set of tasks,achieving a set of non-dominated solutions from which the decisionmaker can select the most adequate one. By experiments, thefeasibility and effectiveness of this algorithm are validated.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W. -P.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), wireless communications, and image processing and classification technologies are combined for generating warnings to an operator in a search mission. Thus, the UAV would be used to cover a specific ground area communicating images the system should be able to classify. In case a positive image is classified (i.e., one with the object/s being searched for), an operator is warned so that the final decision is made by an expert. In this way, the mostly bored task of looking at images without object being looked for is avoided, and the expert attention could be focused on images with a high probability of having the object/s being looked for. A cloud service is used for image classification (IBM Watson) along with a previously proposed UAV system architecture and a low-cost drone SDK. A proof of concept is described, giving implementation details, and preliminary results. Obtained results show that the general system is a viable solution and set a starting point for enhancing several subsystems for better performance.</abstract><custom3>2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

In these scenarios, deploying a UAV swarm instead of a single UAV can provide additional benefits when, for example, cargo carrying requirements exceed the lifting power of a single UAV, or when the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously can accelerate the accomplishment of the mission, and broaden the covered area. To this aim, in this paper we present MUSCOP, a protocol that allows multiple UAVs to perfectly coordinate their flight when performing planned missions. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is able to achieve a high degree of swarm cohesion independently of the swarm formation adopted, and even in the presence of very lossy channels, achieving minimal synchronization delays and very low position offsets with regard to the ideal case.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W.

The network lifetime is restricted to the lifetime of mesh networks of routers that are scattered across a complex disaster environment. We consider the problem of multi-UAVs relaying and moving with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime. UAVs must learn where to move in order to relay messages from the routers efficiently. However, under the dynamics of the router traffic, that is, the uncertainty of the environment, it is challenging for UAVs to find a movement mechanism that maximizes the network lifetime. By embracing the on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm Sarsa, we are able to demonstrate a greedy movement policy. Specifically, we study the trajectory planning of multiple UAVs in a dense wireless router mesh networks (WMNs) on the ground. UAVs can learn the unknown environment by a little movement of UAVs in each step, in which communication connections between routers with UAVs are retained. A Q-table of movement actions and environment states is formed after multiple attempts of movements. Simulation results show the proposal effectiveness comparing with other methods.</abstract><custom3>2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as a rosy technology in the fifth generation (5G) and future mobile communication systems, has been widely studied because of its ability in improving spectral efficiency and reducing transmission latency to enhance the overall Quality of Service (QoS) and meet the strict communication requirements. Based on these, in this article, we propose a device-to-device (D2D)-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture, in which D2D is introduced to increase the file dispatching efficiency. In our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network, the ground users (GUEs) that have already received file blocks (FBs) are allowed to reuse the time-frequency resources assigned to NOMA links to share their FBs with other GUEs, which significantly improves the efficiency of file dispatching. But this also leads to a complicated interference environment. In order to effectively manage the interference and minimize the UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time, we propose a graph-based file dispatching (GFD) protocol, in which the complicated joint optimization problem is decomposed to be solved efficiently and graph theory-based algorithms are proposed for resource allocation. The simulation results verify the advantages of our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture and the efficiency of our designed GFD protocol in minimizing the total UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Mission-critical applications are becoming a vital category of future IoT applications, and due to the advancements in the 5G, the design of mission-critical application overcome a big hurdle. Mission-critical applications must be reliable, and the output should be known in advance. Therefore, to model such application, architecture is considered the cornerstone. One of the major requirements is the flexibility of the operation and the adaptability to new devices. In this paper, an optimal orchestration mechanism is proposed to automate the processes in a conventional multi-device and multi-task mission-critical architecture for flexible and scalable operations. The central goal of this paper is to threefold; first, to model tasks in such a way to maximize the flexibility in the operation plane. Secondly, to design a strongly correlated pair which has maximum relation and thus the chance to hit the task on the devices will be potentially maximized and also the idle time among operations is minimal. Lastly, to register devices in a network which is optimal for the group of this device in terms of correlation. We propose a multi-layer particle swarm optimization for each of the optimization objectives. Results show that the operation plan is flexible and with scaling up the problem size, the orchestration is still graceful and within the requirements of mission-critical applications. The performance of multi-level particle swarm optimization is compared with conventional single-level particle swarm optimization and it has been learned that the later is not only slower but also less accurate.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

To enhance the received signal power and avoid frequent signal collision, RADMA (Rotational Angle Division Multiple Access) has been proposed. In RADMA, a UAV-BS (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Base Station) equipped with ULA (Uniformly Linear Array antenna) is deployed as the mobile data collector, To improve the performance of RADMA when serving a larger area, it is required to design an effective trajectory to dynamically deploy the UAV-BS within the area. In this paper, a simple UAV-BS trajectory decision method based on sectorized K-means clustering is proposed to provide uniform QoS (Quality-of-Service) among all SNs. First, the area is sectorized with equal sector size. Then, the initial centroid coordinate of each cluster is randomly generated within each sector area to avoid biased centroids. Finally, the trajectory is formed by connecting the centroids of the SNs clusters. The numerical results have validated that combining RADMA with sectorized k-means clustering-based trajectory enables all SNs to transmit all the data within a predetermined mission time and with low transmission energy.</abstract><custom3>2020 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

In this paper we focus on using multiple UAVs to cooperatively monitor a crowded area. Communication in such UAVs network is an ongoing project. Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result. The class of the data as well as other relevant information about the detected event will be used by the GCS to authorize or not UAV data transmission and hence to optimize the bandwidth usage efficiency.</abstract><custom3>2019 15th International Wireless Communications &amp; Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V.

These systems, because of the many sensors and actuators they can embed, are suitable for autonomous missions in 3D (Dull, Dirty and Dangerous) environments for instance. However, embedding a large number of capabilities in all of members of a swarm is expensive in terms of cost, weight and energy consumption. Thus, it is usually more efficient to embed only a single or a few capabilities within each UMS. It then becomes necessary to provide a discovery mechanism built into the swarm in order to allow its members to share their capabilities and to collaborate for achieving a global mission. These shared capabilities are called services. In this paper, we propose a new service discovery system called AMiRALE for Asynchronous Missions Relay for Autonomous and Lively Entities dedicated to highly volatile, autonomous and mobile swarms of UMS. Our solution is independent of both nodes' mobility and connectivity patterns. Moreover, it supports heterogeneous swarms and degraded conditions of operation (i.e., Message loss, UMS loss and disconnected network). It is also totally decentralized and enables both discovery and service usage. We provide a description of the theoretical model of our AMiRALE system as well as several simulation results obtained from a park cleaning scenario.</abstract><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Logistics companies especially keep trying to utilize drones for fast delivery following the growing market size of e-commerce. Accordingly, methods for safely operating multi-drone have been researched, and many researchers have proposed various optimal or near-optimal routing methods. However, such methods have some problems that cause routing failures or huge routing computation time in a drone-dense space due to many collisions. In this paper, we propose a centralized framework that deals with enormous collisions and obtains collision-free paths rapidly. We first build a drone energy consumption model with a data-driven method using flight experiment data of a commercial drone to estimate the drone battery state-of-charge (SoC). Then, we develop a novel routing method that generates collision-free paths by considering both the congestion of the space and the SoC of each drone. The proposed method is inspired by the VLSI circuit routing method that connects all signal nets among thousands of logic components. Through numerous delivery routing simulations, we confirm that the proposed method achieves a maximum of 6 times higher routing success rate with a 10x faster runtime compared with the state-of-the-art optimal method. In addition, we validate that the proposed method is applicable to delivery routing problems with various drone battery capacities.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.

Swarm of UAVs can be deployed in a multitude of 24/7 security and surveillance. The network management and pattern formation are crucial for multi-UAV formation control mechanisms while cautiously navigating the surveillance areas. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based Formation Flight Control for Navigation (FFCN) is used to efficiently build the UAV swarm, which decreases networking load by minimizing communication and processing involved in pattern formation. Moreover, through the leader-follower navigation, the network management of the swarm is substantially simplified. The leader-follower approach in FFCN is efficient for multi-UAV as the navigation system needs to find only the leader's trajectory. However, the failure of the leader due to actuator faults decreases the efficiency of the system. The proposed FFCN addresses the above by including a fault-tolerance mechanism, thus improving the system's reliability. Simulation results show that the FFCN model achieves faster convergence in less time with a lower collision rate. The model's usage reduced the collision rate to 3.4% in successful formation without colliding with other UAVs.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

While the multi-UAV systems have a great potential in many different scenarios, increasing complexity of missions gave raise to a new set of problems. Some of them include high workload periods of a single operator supervising multiple agents, loss of the situation awareness, increased amount of the data generated by the system and problems in communication channels between the operator and UAVs. All of them could lead to performance degradation in the mission execution or even critical failures of system elements. In general, there are two aspects that help to avoid or at least to decrease mentioned problems - mission planning and human-machine interface (HMI) design. In this paper, we mainly address the mission planning aspect and only briefly present an HMI design that allows simultaneous handling of three UAVs in civil infrastructure data acquisition missions. The proposed interface, among the standard telemetry data, includes data download/upload from/to external services, a trajectory planner and the acquired data representation. The proposed architecture has been tested in a simulation and in a real environment.</abstract><custom3>2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>U.

Off-the-shelf drone products accessible at reasonable costs are enabling new applications and research directions from crowd management, product delivery, and smart cities to security and military applications. The potential of autonomous swarm missions opens up new research avenues; however, off-the-shelf drone products, as well as most commercial projects, lack features that are required by autonomous collective multi drone missions. One potential reason is that there is no consensus on how to develop drones with cooperative operation capacity systemically. This study suggests a generalized device architecture concerning both hardware and software organization to aid developers of cooperative drones designed for multi-drone missions. The proposed architecture grants autonomy and cooperation within a swarm. An additional solution is also provided to enable ad-hoc networking for drones when the drone platform does not natively support it. The architecture is developed and deployed on ModalAI VOXL m500 developer drone to achieve cooperative swarm sensing and is validated through use cases.</abstract><custom3>MILCOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Swarm technologies by D'Arrigo, P, Santandrea, S. (2005) use context-awareness in short-haul networks between components, and long-distance networks allow communication with Earth. However, the propagation delays limit real-time communications, deep space being an environment in which the speed of light becomes a restriction. Therefore, the development of a protocol stack which is adaptive to application requirements and external influences will help to maximise communication synchronicity. As part of a first year doctorate research programme, this paper correlates current stack functionalities with interplanetary application requirements. A redesigned stack proposes to resolve this misalignment. Context-awareness is incorporated, enabling intelligent protocol selection using application layer knowledge and environmental information, with particular attention given to transport protocols. The paper concludes by considering transport protocol characteristics when deployed beside a context-aware layer, with the long-term aim being the development of a transport protocol suitable for deployment in the state-of-the-art context-aware stack</abstract><custom3>International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems (ICAS'06)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S. -C.

However, to support those UAV swarm service scenarios, UAV management system should be involved and moreover, the system requires a real-time data delivery feature due to the high cruise speed of the UAVs and the low-latency constraints of the command and control message.

Current timing synchronization methods focus on enhancing single-hop skews which remarkably improve timing synchronization precision at this level. The improper clock of the drone system can cause interference, affect spectrum precision and interrupt the operation of the transceiver. In the drones’ network, master drones’ (MD) neighbor drone’s timing synchronization approaches like Reference Broadcast System (RBS) realize a good performance. However, the requirement of one super drone with a large number of broadcasts for RBS makes it unrealistic to use in some situations like SDN network situation. Appropriate study and adjustments are needed to have real timing synchronization by eliminating the clocks drift and enhancing the timing synchronization precision. Therefore, a new self-timing synchronization approach is proposed in this paper where several MD drones can autonomously generate swarm clusters. The cluster head (CH) instigates a timing synchronization procedure starting with intra-Swarm cluster timing synchronization. The intermediate drones (ID) are elected between two swarm clusters to synchronize all drones in line with the inter-swarm cluster timing synchronization approach. The proposed approach is distributed and flexible to achieve high timing synchronization precision. The paper proposes a novel self-timing synchronization approach for in large scale semi-flat SND network architecture. Self-timing synchronization is swarm cluster-based and applicable for a huge number of master drones in SDN. One is the intra-Swarm cluster where the timing synchronization procedure starts with the CH to synchronize all CM. Secondly, in the inter-swarm cluster timing synchronization, two clusters are synchronized via intermediate drone (ID). However, the simulations demonstrated that in many cases all CHs are synchronized by the synchronized CHs from intra-swarm cluster timing synchronizations; this increased the system throughput and synchronization delay to about 75% compared to what we planned to achieve. Moreover, the simulation results also proved that the achieved synchronization precision can be used for position estimation and prediction with high accuracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.

It is our thesis that drone swarms can be used to communicate information enriched with effects via nonverbal channels: guiding, generally interacting with, or warning a human audience via their pattern of motions or behavior. And furthermore that this approach has unique advantages such as flexibility and mobility over other forms of user interface.In this paper, we present a user study to understand how human participants perceived and interpreted swarm behaviors of micro-drone Crazyflie quadcopters flying three different flight formations to bridge the psychological gap between front-end technologies (drones) and the human observers' emotional perceptions. We ask the question whether a human observer would in fact consider a swarm of drones in their immediate vicinity to be nonthreatening enough to be a vehicle for communication, and whether a human would intuit some communication from the swarm behavior, despite the lack of verbal or written language.Our results show that there is statistically significant support for the thesis that a human participant is open to interpreting the motion of drones as having intent and to potentially interpret their motion as communication. This supports the potential use of drone swarms as a communication resource, emergency guidance situations, policing of public events, tour guidance, etc.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems (ICHMS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

Aiming at solving low computational efficiency and poor scalability of the traditional multi-UAV path planning method, the decentralized multi-UAV path planning method suitable for obstacle environments is proposed. Firstly, the UAV rendezvous path planning problem with constraints such as the kinematics of UAVs and collision-free constraints is modeled as a non-convex optimal control problem. To minimize formation rendezvous time and energy consumption, a two-layer coordinative framework is developed to solve this problem. In the coordination layer, relying only on the information of neighboring UAVs, each UAV in the decentralized communication graph negotiates the desired flight time using a consensus protocol to achieve coordination among UAVs. In the planning layer, the initial non-convex formation rendezvous path planning problem is decoupled into several sub-problems, which can be solved in parallel by path planners distributed on each UAV using sequential convex programming. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results show that this decentralized multi-UAV path planning method can handle the minimum-time rendezvous path planning problem and optimize the energy consumption in flight, and the computing time does not increase significantly with the enlargement of the UAV swarm. This decentralized framework scales well with the number of UAVs and can be applied for future urban flight and supplies delivery tasks.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Á.

The ISOC has the potential to enable up to 1 Gbps data rates over a distance up to 200 km in free space. Key features of the ISOC include full sky coverage and the ability to maintain multiple links simultaneously. The Q4 mission consists of (4) 6U CubeSats furnished with ISOCs to demonstrate high data rate communications among the spacecraft. More specifically, we seek to demonstrate the omnidirectionality of the ISOC by providing simultaneous optical links between one spacecraft and the other three. Q4 will be a demonstrator for small spacecraft swarm capabilities. Following a proposed deployment from the ISS, the CubeSats will utilize their onboard thrusters to enter their desired orbit. The orbit consists of one “leader” spacecraft in a circular orbit with a 400 km LEO altitude and three “follower” spacecraft in slightly elliptical orbits rotating azimuthally about the leader. The main mission will consist of three consecutive phases: First, the spacecraft will demonstrate pointing, acquisition, and tracking using newly developed protocols. Next, link establishment and different channel access methods (CDMA and TDMA) will be tested. Finally, Delay Tolerant Network protocols will be implemented to allow fast data sharing among the spacecraft. The distance between the communicating spacecraft will be increased as the mission progresses to characterize the link quality as a function of distance. All communications over the course of the mission will be recorded and analyzed on the ground using bit error rate as a metric for success. The current design for each the four Q4 CubeSats contains an XACT advanced ADCS system for precision beam pointing. Other components currently under consideration include MiPS cold gas thrusters for orbital maneuvering and gimbaled eHaWK 84W solar arrays. In this paper we present design considerations for the Q4 CubeSats, link budget calculations, results from preliminary mission analysis, and expected results.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The use of UAVs promises great potentials in finding missing persons during maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions. Hereby, communication between ground station and vehicle is essential in order to exchange data. Mandatory requirements are high reliability - especially for telemetry and control data - as well as high data rates as an enabler for high resolution thermal imaging and real-time video payloads. The underlying paper investigates the applicability of Long Term Evolution (LTE) for maritime SAR missions. Therefore, in a first step, a detailed maritime channel model is developed and implemented. The analytic evaluations show significant decreases in communication range in dependency of UAV flight and base station height and in dependency of the current wind speed. To compensate interferences and frequency-dependent propagation effects the authors propose the aggregation of multiple LTE links using the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol. The proposed multi-link concept is evaluated and assessed in a close-to-reality evaluation. Hereby, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiment is conducted emulating a public mobile network operator in combination with a dedicated SAR-mission-only LTE link. The experiments highlight the applicability of LTE and MPTCP for maritime SAR missions. The heterogeneous multilink concept increases UAV communication range and achieves high reliability and data rates in the whole search area.</abstract><custom3>2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Research involving multiple UAVs has been carried out in various areas such as force protection, warfare in the military, remote sensing, disaster response activities, and surveillance. While performing critical tasks, efficiency and robustness are important considerations that can be achieved by involving heterogeneous UAV teams with effective communication and coordination techniques. Communication among heterogeneous UAVs is an interesting and critical research area that needs to be thoroughly explored. In this research, an evidence-based approach is adopted to explore research carried out on multiple heterogeneous UAVs and their communication patterns while performing various activities. A mapping study research technique is employed to systematically collect, analyze, and assess the evidence available on the topic under discussion. The time period defined for this study was set from 2005 to 2019, and 46 primary studies were considered for thematic analysis. The findings show that research studies fall under the category of validation research by constructing simulations to provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed solutions. The communication patterns among heterogeneous UAVs involve various components of UAV communication, networking, formation, and path planning. The application areas that were largely focused on were search, rescue, monitoring, and surveillance missions. The overall trend showed that interest in multiple heterogeneous UAV usage increases over time with a focus on UAV networks, formations, and path planning while considering communication as an implicit part of all these structures. This research has conducted an in-depth analysis of existing research on heterogeneous UAVs and provides classification and trends of various themes emerging within this research area.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

With the growing size of the UAV swarm in complex missions, it becomes a challenge to control them for efficient execution of missions. In a traditional centralized communication model where all UAVs in the swarm are controlled directly through ground control, channel capacity limits the number of UAVs in the swarm which restricts the scalability. In the context of low-power miniature drones, we limit the communication of the ground Base Station (gBS) with only one UAV (leader) which controls the rest of the UAVs (followers). Towards this, we propose a greedy heuristic method for selecting the UAV leader that requires minimal time to communicate with the gBS in real-time. The proposed master-slave model enhances the scalability of the swarm by improving the utilization of channel resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic leader selection enhances the lifetime of the entire network with a multifold decrease in energy consumption, compared to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the lifetime of the network also decreases on operating with a single UAV leader. We also observe reductions in delays by almost 60% and an increase in data rate by 50%.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

UAV's observation range and communication methods between UAVs have a significant impact on multi-UAV collaboration strategy. For this purpose, we study the multi-UAV observation range dynamic control method and the optimal inter-UAV communication method. Our approach is to design a multi-UAV joint observation, communication, policy, and service collaboration protocol and study the optimization method of the protocol. We propose an expert-guided deep reinforcement learning framework to optimize this protocol. Each UAV's optimal radar observation range and inter-UAV communication method are learned using an information entropy value decomposition method. Through our observation and communication method, multi-UAV are able to obtain the most valuable information. Experiments demonstrate that our method can improve MEC's service coverage by 9.38%-21.88% compared to the classical MARL algorithm. Our method improves the radar observation efficiency and communication efficiency by 3.05%-38.9% and 8.55%-22.03%, respectively. The results show that this method improves multi-UAV energy utilization.</abstract><custom3>2022 18th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Multi-drone missions based on the existing ROS-based communication architecture heavily depend on the master node, and communication delay between nodes might not be sufficient for efficient inter-agent collision avoidance. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid ROS-ROS2 communication architecture for centralised traffic management with the provision of distributed communication for collision avoidance and conflict resolution at intersections. The base station server responsible for traffic management runs on a ROS2 environment, ROS is used for communication with each onboard autopilot, and an intermediate add-on-module interfaces ROS and ROS2 messages. The content of the communication packets between the different nodes is decided based on the design requirements. Overall communication architecture is validated through simulation and hardware experiments.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE 7th International Conference on Recent Advances and Innovations in Engineering (ICRAIE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Sensed observations are to be delivered to an earth station either directly or through geo-stationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite relays with minimal delay. A cognitive cooperative data scheduling (CCDS) protocol is proposed for spacecrafts to leverage node cooperation and deep learning predictions to fully utilize available link capacities in order to minimize data delivery delay. Either periodically, or on an event-driven basis, each satellite predicts its expected sensing data payload and the link capacities to both Earth and GEO stations. Each spacecraft implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) that continuously learns from observed data to predict the amount of expected data over the scheduling horizon. Nodes with extra link capacity than anticipated data, called the relay nodes, broadcast their availability to act as relays to those with more expected data than their link capacities (called the source nodes). Based on neighbor requests, each relay node computes a data acceptance schedule to minimize the overall data delivery delay of the swarm. During the execution phase, source nodes forward their data to the relay nodes over the satellite crosslinks who then forward their payloads to the desired destination. Performance evaluations on a simulated system based on low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite clusters show the promise of the proposed cognitive cooperative data scheduling protocol to significantly reduce the overall data delivery delay of the swarm and to improve utilization of available link capacities. This CCDS protocol can easily be adapted for swarms of small spacecrafts deployed to the Moon, Mars, near-Earth objects (NEOs), and other distant locations for remote sensing missions.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAAW)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

Autonomous vehicles must embed the capabilities to supervise their behaviour and to detect and react to such events. The complexity increases with the heterogeneity of vehicles in the team and the communication constraints. This paper describes the Robot System Onboard Architecture (RSOA) software developed in the SWARMs project for the achievement of offshore maritime operations. This generic and modular architecture implements high level capabilities in a semiautonomous or autonomous manner, and is deployed at a lower level on a heterogeneous swarm of vehicles.

UAVs have the potential to be employed in public space for pur- poses like surveillance, monitoring, package delivery, emergency services, etc. For proper operation, an efficient path planning among IoD is required so that they can adaptively decide their path for data dissemination. Most of the existing solutions for this problem have made unreasonable assumptions and do not offer scalability. The scheme proposed in the paper provides a network architecture for the scalable solution of UAVs in an urban environment addressing issues of path planning, safety, privacy, and network connectivity.

Mission planning for effective cooperative UAV searching must take into account the connectivity of UAVs for information sharing among UAVs in the FANET. Traditional mission planning usually uses predefined routes or use simple mobility models to generate the trajectories of UAVs, which do not take network connectivity as an important factor for high-quality cooperative searching. On the other hand, many innovative FANET mobility models have been investigated only for FANET simulation. In this paper, we propose a framework applying a recent group mobility model to mission planning with consideration on the network connectivity. For this purpose, we extend the Spatiotemporally Correlated Group Mobility Model (STGM) with adaptivity on its parameters that decide the spatial or temporal correlations among UAVs. Next, we introduce an area information coverage metric to evaluate the quality of mission planning enhanced by this adaptive mobility model. Finally, an algorithm is designed to optimize the metric. The experimental results show that our framework gains impressive improvements on effective information collection by the UAV swarm.</abstract><custom3>2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing &amp; Communications, Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing, Social Computing &amp; Networking, Sustainable Computing &amp; Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

These types of missions are very complex and often involve systems that are not interoperable. From an operational perspective however, some level of integration is necessary. Typically, a common network system architecture and Situation Awareness (SA) platform are required. The architecture allows operators to transfer data between vehicles and their operators, while the SA platform allows to monitor mission progress and react to changes. This paper presents a network system architecture used during an experiment realized in Spring 2016 in Norway. 8 departments from 5 institutions worked together to combine operation of 4 UVs (aerial, surface, underwater), a support vessel and on-shore team. The description is followed by a backbone network performance analysis.

Moreover, since UAV’s energy constrained, it will be a good measure to take multiple UAVs to collect data from devices in large areas. In this paper, we investigate multi-UAV collaborative data collection system, where multiple UAVs collect data from two-dimensional distributed devices on flying mode or hovering mode. The objective is to minimize UAVs’ total flight time while allowing each device to complete data upload successfully with limited energy. To this end, firstly, a cell partition based on Voronoi diagram is used to allocate the collection areas of each UAV. Then, in each associated area, UAV determines the whole trajectory to serve devices. Lastly, given load requirement of ground devices and energy limitation, the optimal data collection mode of each device is decided to minimize flight time of each UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-UAV data collection scheme can shorten collection task completion time significantly.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

Based on the concept of modularity, the proposed architecture divides the overall system into five layers: 1) low-level control layer; 2) high-level control layer; 3) coordination layer; 4) communication layer; and 5) human interaction layer, and many modules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and outputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can be reduced but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale of 21 fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work which successfully demonstrates formation flight, target recognition, and tracking missions within an integrated architecture for fixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

The UAV-MTT system has great potentials to execute dull, dangerous, and critical missions for frontier defense and security. A key challenge in UAV-MTT is how to coordinate multiple UAVs to track diverse invading targets accurately and consecutively. In this article, we propose a UAV swarm-based cooperative tracking architecture to systematically improve the UAV tracking performance. We design an intelligent UAV swarm-based cooperative algorithm for consecutive target tracking and physical collision avoidance. Moreover, we design an efficient cooperative algorithm to predict the trajectory of invading targets accurately. Our simulation results demonstrate that the swarm behaviors stay stable in realistic scenarios with perturbing obstacles. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, such as the matched deep  $Q$ -network, our algorithms can increase tracking accuracy by 60%, reduce tracking delay by 23%, and achieve physical collision-avoidance during the tracking process.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Aiming at this issue, this article is devoted to the design of the multi-UAV flight strategy to improve the cooperative search capability in an uncertain communication environment. Specifically, a new cooperative architecture oriented to a local communication network is devised to control the observation locations of multiple UAVs in the search process, and some local communication networks are established based on the distance among UAVs to meet the requirements of the search task. On this foundation, we develop a multi-UAV cooperative search model (MCSM) with communication cost and formation benefit as an optimization function to ensure the effectiveness of multi-UAV search. Moreover, in the process of model solving, an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) is presented with some different search strategies to enhance the optimization capability. To verify the superiority of the proposed method, we designed several groups of simulation experiments to analyze the performance of MCSM.

Since the lack of cellular connectivity is mostly experienced in rural zones, it is of mandatory importance to design solutions to manage cellular architectures tailored to such zones. To this aim, we consider a new cellular 5G architecture, where the Base Stations (BSs) are carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, we focus on the problem of planning the missions of the UAV-based BSs over the territory, with the goal of minimizing the energy consumed for moving the UAVs. After introducing the considered framework, which is based on a multi-period graph defined over a set of places and a set of Time Slots (TSs), we derive a simple algorithm, called GAUP, to solve the considered problem in a reasonable amount of time. Our results, obtained over a simple - yet representative - scenario, reveals that GAUP is able to efficiently manage the energy for moving the UAVs, while guaranteeing relatively low computation times.</abstract><custom3>2018 9th International Conference on the Network of the Future (NOF)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

However, chasing both low-latency and reliability of consensus protocols is a challenging task. The problem is aggravated under wireless connectivity that may be slower and less reliable, compared to wired connections. To tackle this issue, we investigate fundamental relationships between consensus latency and reliability through the lens of wireless connectivity, and co-design communication and consensus protocols for low-latency and reliable decentralized systems. Specifically, we propose a novel communication-efficient distributed consensus protocol, termed random representative consensus (R2C), and show its effectiveness under gossip and broadcast communication protocols. To this end, we derive a closed-form end-to-end (E2E) latency expression of the R2C that guarantees target reliability, and compare it with a baseline consensus protocol, referred to as referendum consensus (RC). The result shows that the R2C is faster compared to the RC and more reliable compared when co-designed with the broadcast protocol compared to that with the gossip protocol.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

For better swarm coordination, a robust inter-UAV network, especially in ad hoc mode, is needed. Due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks owing to mobility and topology change, adapting routing quickly to topology changes is one of the key components of UAV networks. Based on investigating the relationship between the swarm formation control and the network topology, we propose a proactive topology-aware scheme to track the network topology change. Through simulations on Qualnet and real-world experiments with five quadrotors, the results confirmed that the proposed scheme reduces the average delay and improves routing performance significantly.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

To this end, one of the important problems to address is how to support energy-efficient UAV operation while maintaining reliable connectivity between those aerial users and cellular networks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of cellular-connected UAV via jointly designing the mission completion time and UAV trajectory, as well as communication base station (BS) associations, while ensuring a satisfactory communication connectivity with the ground cellular network during the UAV flight. An optimization problem is formulated by taking into account the UAV’s flight energy consumption and various practical aspects of the air-ground communication models, including BS antenna pattern, interference from non-associated BSs and local environment. The formulated problem is difficult to tackle due to the lack of closed-form expressions and non-convexity nature. To this end, we first assume that the channel knowledge map (CKM) or radio map for the considered area is available, which contains rich information about the relatively stable (large-scale) channel parameters. By utilizing path discretization technique, we obtain a discretized equivalent problem and develop an efficient solution based on graph theory by employing convex optimization technique and a dynamic-weight shortest path algorithm over graph. Next, we study the more practical case that the CKM is unavailable initially. By transforming the optimization problem to a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on multi-step learning and double Q-learning over a dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, where the UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its moving policy according to its local observations of the measured signal samples. Extensive simulations are carried out and the results show that our proposed designs significantly outperform baseline schemes. Furthermore, our results reveal new insights of energy-efficient UAV flight with connectivity requirements and unveil the tradeoff between UAV energy consumption and time duration along line segments.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng Si-wei</author><author>Chen Jing</author><author>Shen Lin-Cheng</author><author>Tao Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECNP-based method of distributed dynamic task allocation for multiple observation satellite planning</title><secondary-title>2010 2nd International Conference on Advanced Computer Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2010 2nd International Conference on Advanced Computer Control</full-title></periodical><pages>325-328</pages><volume>4</volume><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>27-29 March 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICACC.2010.5486945</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A extended contract net protocol(ECNP) is introduced to solve the dynamic task allocation for multiple satellites collaborative planning system(MSCPS) in which the environment and capabilities of each Agent can dynamically change with time.

CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. “Autonomy” is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.</abstract><custom3>Global Oceans 2020: Singapore – U.S. Gulf Coast</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

By determining where search state updates impact search decisions, messages are geographically routed to improve search efficiency. USMP and the geographic greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) protocol are studied via simulation using OPNET modeler 12.0. Geographic routing degrades performance by at least 20% in total searches and distance traveled, but improves direction changes by 6.7%.

To reduce repeated exploration, we develop a mission-based protocol that drives robots to share collected information in stable rendezvous. We also design a complete path planning scheme for both centralized and decentralized cases. To validate that our framework is practical and generic, we present an extensive benchmark and deploy our system into multi-UGV and multi-UAV platforms.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

To achieve this reduced development time, the AMDF will use a new catalog-based and platform-based approach to mission design that emphasizes commonality at the subsystem or assembly level and the use of COTS components when possible. This will necessarily constrain the range of performance achievable by these missions, since only a few alternatives will be available for each subsystem. Only missions whose objectives can be achieved through a combination of the available modules will be considered. In addition to providing a high-level description of the AMDF architecture, this paper describes the process by which this platform consisting of a few standard modules will be optimally designed to maximize the range of attainable performance while keeping short development times. Particular emphasis is put on the communications module that will enable cross-links between nanosatellites, UAVs, balloons, and ground assets. Importantly, the AMDF focuses on a different customer segment than other similar NASA facilities such as the IDC at GSFC or Team X at JPL. AMDF Missions are not meant to compete with larger NASA missions in terms of performance, operational risk or mission assurance, but rather they intend to be complementary. In particular, the very short development time and multi-asset character of these systems will enable a completely new class of missions that can effectively respond to a rapidly changing phenomenon of opportunity, such as a hurricane, a volcano or a geopolitical event of interest for which a larger mission would be inappropriate. Additionally, they can be used to accelerate technology infusion for future larger missions, as long as the new technology satisfies a certain set of interface requirements. The AMDF will maximize reuse of existing design, integration and testing software and hardware infrastructure at NASA Wallops as well as other NASA centers. All potentially relevant stakeholders, such as NASA Goddard, Headquarters, JPL, Ames, the Aerospace Corp., Applied Physics Lab, and universities with nanosatellite programs will be involved and considered in the AMDF development process. This paper focuses on the description of the design aspects of the AMDF, as this is where most of the novelty lies. Integration, testing, launching and operations are only briefly discussed. A description of the system architecture of the AMDF is given using model-based systems engineering tools (SysML). An example application mission to measure ecological changes in the Jefferson and Washington National Forests is also discussed to illustrate the new kinds of missions that this facility could enable.</abstract><custom3>2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

UAVs are being widely deployed in different verticals including surveillance, search and rescue missions, delivery of items, and as an infrastructure for aerial communications in future wireless networks. UAVs can be used to survey target locations, collect raw data from the ground (i.e., video streams), generate computing task(s) and offload it to the available servers for processing. In this work, we formulate a multi-objective optimization framework for both the network resource allocation and the UAV trajectory planning problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model. In consideration of the different stake holders that may exist in a Cloud-Fog environment, we minimize the sum of a weighted objective function, which allows network operators to tune the weights to emphasize/de-emphasize different cost functions such as the end-to-end network power consumption (EENPC), processing power consumption (PPC), UAV’s total flight distance (UAVTFD), and UAV’s total power consumption (UAVTPC). Our optimization models and results enable the optimum offloading decisions to be made under different constraints relating to EENPC, PPC, UAVTFD and UAVTPC which we explore in detail. For example, when the UAV’s propulsion efficiency (UPE) is at its worst (10% considered), offloading via the macro base station is the best choice and a maximum power saving of 34% can be achieved. Extensive studies on the UAV’s coverage path planning (CPP) and computation offloading have been conducted, but none has tackled the issue in a practical Cloud-Fog architecture in which all the elements of the access, metro and core layers are considered when evaluating the service offloading in a distributed architecture like the Cloud-Fog.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J. -J.

Swarms of unmanned aerial systems can aid in multiple applications such as protecting humans in war or natural disasters, conditioning infrastructure or asset monitoring, acting on a target, or package/medical drug delivery applications. If a single swarm member becomes immobilized, the swarm can still complete its task – assuming it is correctly programmed. The design framework for swarms is a complex problem in today’s aviation industry. Factors such as the selection of drones, a means of communication type, architecture, and autonomous flight pattern are all difficult decisions. Early adaption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology seems promising to realize autonomous swarm navigation and control. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art swarm-based UAS and recommends specific types, modes of communication, architectures, and swarm patterns for particular applications.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (eIT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

The cellular-connected UAV has a mission to travel from an initial location to a destination. In this process, there is a trade-off between the flight time and the expected communication outages duration, which requires planning a suitable route to avoid the weak coverage region. However, as the existing cellular networks are primarily designed for ground coverage, the communication coverage in the sky tends to be intermittent and irregular due to the potential for severe interference and obstructions (such by buildings), which brings great challenges to 3D path planning. To address this challenge, we first construct a 3D coverage map that stores the expected outage probability over each locations. We then propose a multi-step dueling DDQN (multi-step D3QN) based algorithm to design the local optimal UAV path by leveraging the constructed coverage map. In this algorithm, the UAV acts as the agent to learn the appropriate action to complete the flight mission. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for connectivity-aware UAV path planning and the superiority of 3D path design over its 2D counterparts.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

In mobile cloud computing (MCC) and mobile edge computing (MEC), UAVs assist ground user equipments (UEs) to offload traffic to cloudlet or cloud. In this scenario, different UEs may have different quality of experience (QoE) requirement. Moreover, the endurance flying as well as battery limitation of UAVs and UEs make this offloading architecture power sensitive. Thus, UEs' QoE, as well as overall system power consumption should be well-balanced by the MIMO channel assignment and UAVs' trajectory plan. This paper formulates such issue as a non-convex and mixed-integer optimization problem, and further proposes a heuristic joint power and QoE (HJPQ) algorithm to solve it. The numeral simulations reveal the algorithm has great QoE performance with high energy efficiency in different conditions.</abstract><custom3>2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Multi-UAV systems have been used in an increasing number of mission scenarios and routing protocols play a critical role in UAV network communications. It is now well established that unstable link quality and frequently changing network topology pose significant challenges for messages forwarding in UAV networks. Hence, traditional mobile ad-hoc network routing protocols do not fit well in UAV networks. In many UAV applications, the flight paths of UAVs are planned in advance before performing missions. The positions and motion information of UAVs are available through Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial sensors, which can be utilized to calculate the future positions of UAVs. Therefore, the future topology of the UAV network is also available. However, existing work does not take advantage of this information. Based on the trajectory, location and motion information of the UAVs, this paper proposes a future network topology-aware routing (FNTAR) protocol, which uses future location information to make superior routing decisions. Moreover, to mitigate data loss problems caused by unstable links and highly dynamic topology, FNTAR can forward messages to multiple excellent next-hop UAVs based on future network topology, and these UAVs can deliver messages to destinations faster. We implement FNTAR in the simulation experiment, the simulation results demonstrate that FNTAR can achieve lower latency and higher delivery ratio than DTNgeo protocol.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F. -q.

However, such systems using RTK-GPS do not provide the protection against network instability, failure of the components that make up the RTK-GPS service. In other words, availability is not provided to ensure the stability of the RTK-GPS. In this paper, we propose an architecture enabling redundancy to improve the availability of RTK-GPS system by switching or parallelizing the GPS correction data sources. We also introduce how to propagate the correction messages through the drone network. After evaluating the system on empirical testbed, we validated that the correction messages propagated without delay, the message source was switched or multiplexed among several message sources through the proposed system when the network was unstable, and the switching time was short enough not to affect our propagation system. Consequently, we have confirmed availability through the proposed architecture of RTK-GPS redundancy.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

By using the huge potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mm-Wave, we develop a novel and practical multi-UAV assisted multi-tier HetNet model which consists of clustered aerial UAV base stations (U-BSs) and Poisson point process (PPP) based ground BSs (G-BSs) for emergency and crowded hotspot area. In a typical cluster, both ground user equipments (GUEs) and UAVs are modeled as Poisson cluster process (PCP) and scattered around the common cluster center. Specially, the analysis is conducted by adding two additional tiers which consist of multiple intra-cluster U-BSs and single G-BS in representative cluster so that the point sets of U-BSs and G-BSs are partitioned into two sub-sets, respectively, and a 4-tier network model is formed. To find the contribution of the inter-cluster associations on the performance of networks, we construct 2-tier and 4-tier association schemes. The 2-tier association allows a GUE associated only with intra-cluster U-BSs and G-BS, while the 4-tier association allows all inter/intra-cluster U-BSs and G-BSs can be associated. Then, according to stochastic geometry methods, statistical description of the downlink interferences experienced at a typical GUE is derived. This derivation yields the downlink coverage probabilities and total network throughput are obtained. It is achieved that association probabilities greatly depend on the distribution of daughter point process. UAVs' height and the distributions of U-BSs and GUEs impose non-monotonous impact on coverage probabilities. Due to severe inter-cluster interference, the achievable average area throughput is not always increasing with SINR so that there is an optimal SINR threshold. In addition, our analysis finds the proposed 4-tier association scheme outperforms the simple 2-tier one in terms of the average area throughput.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Swarms of UAVs may further increase the effectiveness of these tasks, since they enable larger coverage, more accurate or redundant sensed data, fault tolerance, etc. Swarms of aerial robots require real-time coordination, which is just a specific case of M2M collaboration. But one of the biggest challenges of UAV swarming is that this real-time coordination has to happen in a wide-area setting where it is expensive, or even impossible, to set up a dedicated wireless infrastructure for this purpose. Instead, one has to resort to conventional 3G/4G wireless networks, where communication latencies are in the range of 50-150 ms. In this paper we tackle the problem of UAV swarm formation and maintenance in areas covered by such mobile network, and propose a bandwidth-efficient multi-robot coordination algorithm for these settings. The coordination algorithm was implemented on the top of our mobile middleware SDDL, uses its group-cast communication capability, and was tested with simulated UAVs.</abstract><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

UAVs inherently support features like mobility, flexibility, adaptive altitude, which make them a preferable option for dynamic surveillance of remote locations. Multiple UAVs can cooperatively work to accomplish surveillance missions more efficiently. However, the intermittent network connectivity and the limited onboard energy storage impose a great challenge on UAV-assisted remote surveillance. This paper presents an Energy-efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance (ECMS) system for surveillance of inaccessible regions. The system employs an optimal Multi-UAV Collaborative Monocular Vision (MCMV) topology to facilitate the surveillance with zero blind spot using minimum number of drones. We also propose an application-aware Multi-Path Weighted Load-balancing (MWL) routing protocol for handling congestion by distributing traffic among all available resources in UAV network and adaptively selecting the of source datarate (i.e. switching video resolution). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed surveillance system achieves coverage with lesser number of UAVs compared to the existing systems. It also achieves higher throughput, higher packet-delivery ratio, higher residual energy of UAVs, and lower end-to-end delay.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

Drones appeal to mission architects looking to extend the toolbox provided to operators performing challenging missions such as public safety operations. However, careful analysis of the operational context and concept of operations must take place before major acquisitions. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model-based operational architecture definition framework, which is based on the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) ontology and uses Object Process Methodology (OPM) as its underlying modeling language. Through careful mapping of DoDAF Operational Viewpoint (OV) ontology to OPM ontology, we were able to show that the entire OV ontology can be covered by a small set of objects, processes, relations among them, and constructs comprising them. We then show how to instantiate the ontology to create a model of an actual architecture of interest (AoI) while maintaining strong typing of the model elements to ensure validity, integrity, consistency, and continuous compliance with the OV. We demonstrate our approach on the case of using drones in public safety enterprises for the purpose of crowd management in massively attended events and locations. The proposed framework allows for capturing ConOps and OpsCon in a lightweight, yet robust and consistent manner, and improve communication and concept validation between operational stakeholders and enterprise architects.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Amazon has an issued patent that describes how drones scan and collect data on their fly-overs while dropping off packages. In this context, we propose a path optimization algorithm for a drone multi-hop communications network that can carry and forward data in addition to its primary function of parcel deliveries. We argue that traditional Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) based protocols may not be efficient for this purpose. Therefore, this paper proposes a new DTN-based algorithm that optimizes drone flight paths in conjunction with optimized routing to deliver both parcels and data in a power efficient way and within the shortest possible time. We propose a heuristic algorithm called Weighted Flight Path Planning (WFPP) that priorities the data packets in an exchange pool in order to create an optimized path for the drones. Our approach is to determine a weight for each packet based on the packet's remaining time to live, priority, size, and location of the packet's destination. When two drones meet each other, they exchange the high weighted packets. Simulation studies show that WFPP delivers up to 25% more packets compared with EBR, EPIDEMIC, and a similar path planning method. Also, WFPP reduces the data delivery delays by up to 66% while the overhead ratio is low.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

Commonly, multi-UAV systems require to reach and maintain a specific flight formation during mission execution. This can be achieved by using a distributed UAV formation control strategy in which each UAV has a flight controller whose function is to calculate the control actions for the UAV actuators such that the UAV formation is maintained. To perform this task, the control strategy requires the reliable and timely exchange of information within the UAV formation. The information that is needed by the controller is commonly referred to as state information (SI). It has been assumed that SI can be properly disseminated by means of multi-hop communications, i.e., by deploying a flying ad-hoc network (FANET). In this sense, multi-hop broadcast protocols (MBPs) that were previously proposed for mobile and vehicular ad-hoc networks seem to be suited for this task. However, previous work dealing with distributed UAV formation control has made communication and networking assumptions that would be hard to fulfill in actual FANET deployments. Moreover, the efficiency of the MBPs to disseminate SI within a FANET remains unexplored. The goal of this paper is to analyze how the network performance offered by different MBPs impacts the effectiveness of distributed UAV formation control to maintain UAV formation. An evaluation framework to perform this task is proposed in this paper. The simulation results demonstrate the relevance of MBP performance in SI message dissemination and thus in the ability of the controller to maintain a formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Existing solutions for search missions in both terrestrial and aerial domains are mostly limited to single agent and specific environments; however, search missions can significantly benefit from the use of multiple agents that can quickly adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) that realizes the actor-critic framework in a distributed manner for coordinating multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the exploration of unknown regions. One of the original aspects of our work is that the actors represent simulated or actual UAVs exploring the environment in parallel instead of traditional computer threads. Also, we propose addition of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network layers to the actor and critic architectures to handle imperfect communication and partial observability scenarios. The proposed approach has been evaluated in a grid world and has been compared against other competing algorithms such as Multi-Agent Q-Learning, Multi-Agent Deep Q-Learning to show its advantages. More generally, our approach could be extended to image-based/continuous action space environments as well.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE 17th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

Common to these flight controllers is the use of the Micro Air Vehicle Communications Protocol (MAVLink) that allows the flight controller to communicate with a ground control station. However, it is still challenging to experiment with multiple such aerial vehicles concurrently. To this end, we have developed an open software/hardware platform - the University at Buffalo's Airborne Networking and Communications testbed (UB-ANC) - that facilitates rapid development and deployment of multi-drone applications. In this paper, we present the UB-ANC Emulator, an emulation environment to design, implement, and test various applications (missions) involving one or more drones in software, and provides seamless transition to experimentation. We validate the UB-ANC Emulator's output against experimental data collected in a mission with three networked drones to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy, and we demonstrate its scalability up to 100 drones using a simulated “leader-follower” mission.</abstract><custom3>2016 IEEE International Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots (SIMPAR)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Failure to communicate remotely sensed mission data to the base may render the system ineffective, and the inability to exchange command and control messages can lead to system failures. This paper describes a unique method to control communications through distributed task allocation to engage under-utilized UAVs to serve as communication relays and to ensure that the network supports mission tasks. The distributed algorithm uses task assignment information, including task location and proposed execution time, to predict the network topology and plan support using relays. By explicitly coupling task assignment and relay creation processes the team is able to optimize the use of agents to address the needs of dynamic complex missions. The framework is designed to consider realistic network communication dynamics including path loss, stochastic fading, and information routing. The planning strategy is shown to ensure that agents support both datarate and interconnectivity bit-error-rate requirements during task execution. System performance is characterized through experiments both in simulation and in outdoor flight testing with a team of three UAVs.</abstract><custom3>2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

Spatial reuse has been adopted to enable simultaneous data transmission among unmanned aerial vehicles in a context of spatial diversity. This work introduces two types of UAV: a single main actor UAV and multiple actor UAVs. Since these UAVs cooperatively perform a mission, packet collisions and signal interference can degrade a real time data transmission among them. In light of this, we propose a circularly multi-directional beam forming array antenna to be used on the main actor UAV and each UAV is equipped with a directional antenna. These two kinds of antenna are deployed so that packet collisions and signal interference can be alleviated. The main UAV is positioned in the center and surrounded by actor UAVs. By using different antennas on different types of UAV and based on the UAVs positioning, the paper proposes two MAC protocols. While both proposed MAC protocols adopt a conventional IEEE 802.11 MAC, the second one introduces a certain threshold value of angle between UAVs to enable a spatial reuse. Simulation results confirm that our proposed MAC protocols offer a huge gain in system throughput compared to an IEEE 802.11 protocol.</abstract><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

This study evaluates the trade-offs from a System-of-Systems (SoS) perspective between various UAV communications architecture options for the purpose of tracking ballistic missiles. An agent-based discrete event simulation is used to model a sensor communication network consisting of UAVs, military communications satellites, ground relay stations, and a mission control center. Network susceptibility to cyber attack is modeled with probabilistic failures and induced data variability, with performance metrics focusing on information availability, latency, and trustworthiness. Results demonstrated that using UAVs as routers increased SoS availability and satellite-based networks were best for long distance operations. Redundancy in the number of links between nodes helped mitigate cyber-caused link failures and add robustness in cases of induced data variability. Sensitivity studies indicated that long cyber-caused downtimes resulted in build-ups of failures, causing significant degradations in SoS performance.</abstract><custom3>2011 6th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

For passive tags the factors affecting the performance of the reader-tag communication depends on many physical and geometrical parameters. Line of sight is a constraint of the reader-tag link while scattering objects producing electromagnetic interferences affect the shape and the extension of the read-zone i.e. the region where a reader can activate a tag. This region depends not only on the emitted power and reader/tag antennas radiation patterns but also on the propagation environment. When a number of readers are planned in a network, mutual coverage of read-zones and mutual interference among readers are undesired while safety regulation constraints have to be fulfilled in the whole area.

Compared to single UAVs, using multiple UAVs as a collaborative swarm is considerably more effective for target tracking, reconnaissance, and surveillance missions because of their capacity to tackle complex problems synergistically. Success rates in target detection and tracking depend on map coverage performance, which in turn relies on network connectivity between UAVs to propagate surveillance results to avoid revisiting already observed areas. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing three objectives for a swarm of UAVs: (a) target detection and tracking, (b) map coverage, and (c) network connectivity. Our approach, Dual-Pheromone Clustering Hybrid Approach (DPCHA), incorporates a multi-hop clustering and a dual-pheromone ant-colony model to optimize these three objectives. Clustering keeps stable overlay networks, while attractive and repulsive pheromones mark areas of detected targets and visited areas. Additionally, DPCHA introduces a disappearing target model for dealing with temporarily invisible targets. Extensive simulations show that DPCHA produces significant improvements in the assessment of coverage fairness, cluster stability, and connection volatility. We compared our approach with a pure dual- pheromone approach and a no-base model, which removes the base station from the model. Results show an approximately 50% improvement in map coverage compared to the pure dual-pheromone approach.</abstract><custom3>2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Meanwhile, emerging B5G services demand for higher SE in the NOMA-based wireless communications. However, traditional ground-to-ground (G2G) communications are hard to satisfy these demands, especially for the cellular uplinks. To solve these challenges, this article proposes a multiple unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs)-aided uplink NOMA method. In detail, multiple hovering UAVs relay data for a half of ground users (GUs) and share the spectrums with the other GUs that communicate with the base station (BS) directly. Furthermore, this article proposes a K-means clustering-based UAV deployment scheme and location-based user pairing (UP) scheme to optimize the transceiver association for the multiple UAVs-aided NOMA uplinks. Finally, a sum power minimization-based resource allocation problem is formulated with the lowest Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints. We solve it with the message-passing algorithm and evaluate the superior performances of the proposed scheduling and paring schemes on SE and energy efficiency (EE). Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the performances of the proposed schemes with those of the single UAV-aided NOMA uplinks, G2G-based NOMA uplinks, and the proposed multiple UAVs-aided uplinks with a facility location framework-based UAV deployment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multiple UAVs deployment and UP-based NOMA scheme significantly improves the EE and the SE of the cellular uplinks at the cost of only a little relaying power consumption of UAVs.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

In this paper, we investigate a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based UAV relaying network that helps data transmission from a base station (BS) to remote multiple users. To improve spectral efficiency of the investigated UAV relaying network, we provide a generalized user grouping protocol that partitions users into multiple groups and transmit data via NOMA within the same group. Then, we further formulate a joint optimization problem of the NOMA user grouping, the UAV position, and the UAV transmit power to maximize the system throughput. The formulated problem is non-convex which makes it difficult to solve directly, hence, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution.

We first build the 3D model of a random irregular terrain and propose a geometric way to project the 3D terrain surface into many weighted 2D patches. Then we develop a two-level hierarchical UAV swarm architecture, including the low-level follower UAVs (FUAVs) and the high-level leader UAVs (LUAVs). For FUAVs, we design a coverage trajectory algorithm to carry out specific coverage tasks within patches based on the star communication topology. For LUAVs, we propose a swarm deep Q-learning (SDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm to select patches. Moreover, an observation history model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mean embedding method is integrated into SDQN to address the communication limitation problems of LUAVs. The numerical results show that FUAVs can cover the entire area of each patch with little redundancies, and the total coverage time of the SDQN is less than that of existing methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) being deployed to facilitate data collection from MTCDs is considered. Taking into account the limited energy for both the UAV and MTCDs, a problem of minimizing the total energy consumption subject to completion of the data collection tasks by planning the UAV trajectory is formulated. A Global Optimum (GOP) trajectory can be obtained for a UAV serving all the MTCDs simultaneously if the UAV’s flying altitude is larger than  $\sqrt {3}$  times its maximum service radius. However, communication energy efficiency drops as the UAV’s altitude increases. Clustering-based service strategies and dynamic trajectory planning algorithms, namely clustered GOP (C-GOP) and clustered particle swarm optimization (C-PSO), are proposed to overcome the above issue. The data collection efficiency is maximized by locating the optimal UAV hovering point for each serving MTCD cluster, which is dynamically adjusted with the UAV hovering position until all MTCDs are served. It is shown that the GOP is the optimal strategy for a small number of MTCDs concentrated in a small area. While for large number of MTCDs or task area, the clustered algorithms are more favorable from energy efficiency, complexity and scalability perspectives.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

The UTM system is proposed for UAV performance below and above 400 feet based on CAA regulations. A general ADS-B Like communication infrastructure adopting multiple communication devices is designed and tested for wide coverage considering sub-urban and remote areas. Based on the UAV Specification Management System (SMS), the hierarchical UTM will accept UAV flight applications by qualification verification of pilot and UAV registrations, and proceed to check the flight plan. One of the ADS-B like communication choice shall be selected and equipped on airborne with pilot's mobile phone being pre-test before flight approval. A "UTM Cloud" is constructed for data exchange and accessing. Flight surveillance data are reported into the Cloud with limited authorization to access by simple encryption. The UTM Center establishes parallel computer system with multi-window to display all UAVs in flight operation. UTM-based Detect and avoid (DAA) is activated by calculating the time to conflict (TTC) when two UAVs are approaching into the same airspace. Traffic alerts to pilots via personal mobile phones will be sent by voice calls from UTM controller for avoidance. Since the proposed ADS-B Like communication can cover wider range, the Regional UTM and National UTM are integrated in one center during the initial operations while UAV traffic density is still low. The prototype UTM is tested and demonstrated under hierarchical architecture to assure UAV flight safety.</abstract><custom3>2019 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Such scenario demands continuous monitoring of the region and take account of its priority areas which will require control interactions, both in mission planning and execution. The methodology approach is based on priority gradients combined with region partitioning, where the points of greatest interest are updated more frequently. The proposed system is based on the coordination of embedded agents using spatial coordination on strategical positioning and role exchange. The system architecture is composed by three modules, namely, the ground control station, for mission planning and control through user interaction; a quadrotors team, capable of navigation by inertial and satellite systems; and the control agents embedded in aircrafts, responsible for communications, task allocation and payload mission control. The preliminary results are validated using both computer simulation and a real flight with quadrotors. Telemetry data from the results were compared and it demonstrate that the proposed methodology converges to an effective solution.</abstract><custom3>2017 International Conference on Military Technologies (ICMT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

Multi-UAV System of Systems (SoS) have proliferated due to their abilities to work autonomously, to decentralize mission workload and to exhibit resiliency in the ability to retain mission functionality even if a UAV node or network connectivity is lost. This resiliency is not inherent, and must be architected into both the SoS and UAV node/payload, especially in the areas of communications, control, ad-hoc networking, and path planning. As an exemplar, the Resilient System Engineering (RSE) process will be used to derive and identify resilience attributes for a Multi-UAV SoS architecture. For this paper, the Multi-UAV SoS will be tasked for Search and Rescue (SAR) and use a Time/Frequency Difference of Arrival (T/FDOA) based location algorithm to locate agents in distress. A simulation of the SAR SoS, using Contract-Based Design (CBD) invariant contracts are used to quantify the intended resilience/emergence attributes of the Multi-UAV SAR SoS and the T/FDOA location approach.</abstract><custom3>2019 International Symposium on Systems Engineering (ISSE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.

UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The resource constraints and dynamic nature of the swarm bring critical challenges to the design of UAV routing protocols. Most of the conventional ad hoc routing schemes are not intelligent and cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of UAV swarming networks. On the other hand, some artificial intelligence (AI)-based routing schemes may consume significant computational resources in the UAVs. In this article, a low-cost, adaptive routing protocol, namely skeleton-based swarm routing (SSR), is proposed, which exploits an intelligent online learning algorithm and the topology features of the mission-driven UAV swarm to distribute the traffic over optimal routes. Here, the skeleton represents the most stable parts of the swarm formation. SSR architecture consists of three modules: 1) A geometric addressing module, which assigns geometric coordinates to each node based on the swarm skeleton structure; 2) A leaf-like routing pipe which allows the selection of multiple candidate routes around the shortest path; 3) An intelligent low-complexity learning model which determines how to distribute the packets inside the routing pipe to achieve load-balanced, high-throughput transmissions. The proposed skeleton-based scheme can also facilitate the UAV formation construction and morphing. The simulation results show that the proposed SSR protocol can noticeably improve the network performance (up to 100% throughput improvement) compared to the single path routing schemes, such as the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and link-quality and traffic-load aware optimized link state routing (LTA-OLSR) protocols.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

Each UAV can first cache the sensing data and then report the cached data to the BS. We consider a time-slotted protocol to coordinate the UAVs' data collection and reporting. Only one UAV is allowed to forward its data to the BS in each time slot. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the longterm age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the UAVs' trajectories and scheduling strategies. To simplify this problem, we model the dynamics of the UAVs' data buffer and AoI statuses by queueing systems, and propose a novel AoI-aware Adaptation scheme. This scheme allows us to transform the multistage dynamic programming problem into per-slot scheduling and trajectory planning sub-problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, in each time slot, we can update the UAVs' scheduling and flying strategies in an iterative manner according to the instant buffer and AoI statuses. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline schemes in terms of reducing AoI while stabilizing and balancing the UAVs' data queues.</abstract><custom3>GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

After analyzing typical features of task cooperation, a hierarchical architecture of task models is firstly proposed and established, where mission, sub-mission and atom task models are designed, from the top-level to the bottom. Meanwhile, a policy-based parsing mechanism is proposed to autonomously decompose a mission into a set of atom tasks with special constraints. On this basis, resource related entities for various atom tasks are designed uniformly, and for the purpose of behavior synchronization, the concept of virtual logic task is further introduced and Topic-based communication channel is adopted over DDS middleware.

Multi-UAV systems organized in an ad hoc fashion called a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can cooperatively and collaboratively accomplish complex missions more efficiently compared to single large UAV systems. However, the unique features of FANETs such as high mobility, low node density, and high frequency of topology changes introduce challenges to the communication design, especially routing. Thus, the routing requirements of FANETs surpass those of MANETs or VANETs. In this paper, we present UAV classification, communication and application architectures, and an exhaustive survey of the existing routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks. Furthermore, we highlight the key features, strengths and weaknesses, and different mobility models used for the performance evaluation of the existing FANET routing protocols. More importantly, a proposed taxonomy and a review on the existing FANET routing protocols are presented. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges and open research issues.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Q.

However, current researches aimed to target tracking in mobile MC-SSN are very limited. This paper first proposes an adaptive fuzzy tree system (AFS) for target tracking in MC-SSN. To avoid oversimplifying the target mobile pattern, which is unrealistic in real tracking tasks, we introduce the target circle into the model considerations to add a bit of uncertainty about the target position. At each time step of the tracking process, strategy-selection layer will activate the pursuit strategy or the diffusion strategy for the specific situation, which makes the system more intelligent and can be applicable to various scenarios. The pursuit strategy is built by a two-layer fuzzy tree to select and mobilize sensors that have not detected target, while the diffusion strategy uses a fuzzy inference system to balance the density of detected sensors. And all the hyper-parameters are tuned by particle swarm optimization (PSO). We performed a large number of simulations with two target trajectories: line and irregular. The simulation results show that the AFS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm. Moreover, it is highly robust to various target motion patterns, making it competent for a variety of real target tracking scenarios.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jian Shu</author><author>Yangfan Ge</author><author>Linlan Liu</author><author>Limin Sun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mobility prediciton clustering routing in UAVs</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1983-1987</pages><volume>3</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>24-26 Dec. 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICCSNT.2011.6182360</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper proposes a Mobility Prediction Clustering Routing (MPCR) algorithm in view of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) moves at a high speed and its topology changes frequently.

It is now possible to utilize tens and thousands of them to form a swarm to complete complicated cooperative tasks, such as searching, rescuing, mapping, and battling. A swarm usually contains a large number of robots or devices, which are in short distance to each other and may move dynamically. So this paper studies the dynamic and dense swarms. The ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is proposed to serve as the fundamental technique for both networking and localization, because UWB is so time sensitive that an accurate distance can be calculated using timestamps of the transmit and receive data packets. A UWB swarm ranging protocol is designed in this paper, with key features: simple yet efficient, adaptive and robust, scalable and supportive. This swarm ranging protocol is introduced part by part to uncover its support for each of these features. It is implemented on Crazyflie 2.1 drones, STM32 microcontrollers powered aerial robots, with onboard UWB wireless transceiver chips DW1000. Extensive real world experiments are conducted to verify the proposed protocol with a total of 9 Crazyflie drones in a compact area.</abstract><custom3>IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N.

Hence, the cloud-based computation offloading is widely adopted, nevertheless, for some latency-sensitive tasks, e.g., object recognition, path planning, etc., the cloud-based manner is inappropriate due to the excessive delay. Even in some harsh environments, e.g., disaster area, battlefield, etc., there is no wireless infrastructure existed to combine the drones and cloud center. Thus, to solve the problem encountered by cloud-based computation offloading, in this paper, Fog Computing aided Swarm of Drones (FCSD) architecture is proposed. Considering the uncertainty factors in harsh environments which may threaten the success of FCSD processing tasks, not only the latency model, but also the reliability model of FCSD is constructed to guarantee the high reliability of task completion. Moreover, in view of the limited battery life of the drone, we formulated the problem as the task allocation problem which minimized the energy consumption of FCSD under the constraints of latency and reliability. Furthermore, to speed up the process of the optimization problem solving to improve the practicality, relying on the recent advances in distributed convex optimization, we develop a fast Proximal Jacobi Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based distributed algorithm. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O.

This has given rise to new systems called UAVs Traffic Management (UTM) systems. Nevertheless, currently, there is a lack of communication infrastructures that can support the requirements of UTM systems. Luckily, the envisioned 5G mobile network has introduced the concept of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) in its architecture to support mission-critical applications by decreasing the end-to-end latency and the unreliability of communication. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the network latency and reliability on the control of UAVs' flights. The obtained results show that a UAV can deviate from its intended path with more than 5m if the network latency exceeds 400ms and with more than 2m if the packet loss probability exceeds 0.2. To overcome these limitations, we have leveraged MEC to provide a new UTM framework that enables an efficient traffic management. Moreover, due to MEC resource-limited nature and in order to give an insight about the resource provisioning, we have evaluated the scalability of the proposed solution in terms of the number of UAVs that can be handled without affecting the efficiency of the proposed UTM framework.</abstract><custom3>2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Meanwhile, it was worth noting that the terminal node may be disturbed by aggregated interference caused by dense network signaling interaction in the future 5G/B5G systems. Therefore, after TS and PS protocols designing and utilizing, the closed-form expressions of outage probability and bit error rate (BER) for UAV relay assisted IoT systems suffered from aggregated interference were derived in detail. In addition, the throughput and delay limited state of UAV relay assisted transmission were also analyzed thoroughly. The derivations and analysis results showed that the proposed multi-parameter joint optimization of transmitting power, scaling factor, and UAV relay selection could effectively improve the system throughput and reduce the system outage probability and BER. The simulation experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and the correctness of theoretical analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

The UGVs are used as mobile actuators and scattered in a large area. To achieve multi-UGV communication and collaboration, the UAV, modeled as a Dubins vehicle, serves as a messenger to fly over the effective communication range of all UGVs to relay information. The curvature-constrained path planning of the messenger UAV is formulated as a Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Dynamic Neighborhood (DTSPDN) which is a complex optimization problem involving coupled variables and contains dynamic constraints. We design an effective memetic algorithm to find the shortest route that enables the messenger UAV to visit all moving UGVs. This algorithm combines the genetic algorithm procedure, two kinds of local search operators based on gradient search and uniform sampling respectively, and a gradient-based repair operator to repair the solutions violating dynamic constraints. During the evolutionary process, a special phenomenon may occur that changing some decision variables (i.e., visiting sequence and location) may not affect the evaluation function value, but may alter the feasible region of another decision variable (i.e., visiting time) due to the encounter constraint between the UAV and UGV. To track and utilize the change of the feasible region, a transformation procedure is proposed to change one solution to another with less visiting time by analyzing the encounter pattern between UAV and UGV. The computational results on random instances with different scales demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively generate better curvature-constrained tours to encounter all moving UGVs when compared to other four competitive algorithms in the literature. Note to Practitioners—This paper studies an emerging path planning problem for a UAV which is used to provide communication service for multiple moving UGVs. These UGVs are required to execute tasks (e.g., firefighting, search and rescue) within a large area. Due to their limited communication capabilities, they may be unable to obtain necessary information from other UGVs. The UAV serves as a messenger to fly over the effective communication range of all moving UGVs to relay information. We propose a novel memetic algorithm to efficiently search for the shortest tour that enables the messenger UAV to visit all moving UGVs. The memetic algorithm combines the parallel global search virtue of genetic algorithm with efficient local search procedure to improve the generated tour. A gradient-based repair procedure is also employed to make sure that the planned tour can guide the UAV to sequentially encounter each moving UGV. Simulations exhibit that the proposed approach can effectively generate high-quality tours for messenger UAV to rapidly visit all UGVs, which assists UGVs to achieve collaboration in large area. In future work, the proposed memetic algorithm will be extended to plan tours for multiple messenger UAVs.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Dynamic, delay and disruption tolerant communications and networking topologies at various Quality of Service levels are needed to meet future mission requirements, which may include multiple spacecraft flying in formation and coordinating among themselves. Additionally, secure proximity- and autonomous-communication among various types of space vehicles are needed to share rich, near real-time streams of information. Along with scalability and extensibility, cybersecurity is a crucial requirement for autonomous communications in space. taraCoAP is based on the terrestrial standard Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and along with its Cyber-Physical Autonomous Asset Observation and Management extension provides delay and disruption tolerant, autonomous communication among swarms or clusters of spacecraft to implement complex and time-varying networks to coordinate, collaborate and share rich streams of information.

Specifically, they are made from commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronic circuit chips, and are thus seen as a cost effective replacement for traditional, expensive satellites. Moreover, they are expected to have higher capabilities to better support demanding missions. To date, most CubeSats rely on a single element antenna that usually has a relatively low gain and are not steerable. Thus, they are not suitable for long-distance communications and for use by missions requiring high-speed links and adjustable radiation patterns. Existing single element antennas also increase the probability of failure when establishing communication links, as the failure of the single element would lead to a disconnection. In this paper, we propose a 3×1 dipole antenna array and a cluster of three 3×1 dipole antenna arrays for CubeSats. Each array can theoretically be used on a separate frequency. Advantageously, all three arrays can be combined to enhance directivity. Our simulation results show that the proposed antenna cluster has a high gain of 5.03dB and wide directivity.</abstract><custom3>2016 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

A unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) user and ground users (GUEs) are served by ground base stations (GBSs) by utilizing uplink NOMA protocol. The goal is to minimize the UAV mission completion time by jointly designing the UAV trajectory and UAV-GBS association vectors while considering the interference of UAV to other non-associated GBSs. The formulated problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem and involves infinite number of variables, which is difficult to be directly solved. To tackle this challenge, we first prove the optimal UAV trajectory satisfies \emph{fly-hover-fly} communication policy. With this insight, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the original problem based on a properly constructed graph by invoking graph theory and convex optimization techniques.

UAVs should collect data for a defined area with a variety of sensors. When these UAVs are operating in swarm formation, the observation area could be increased and it would also be possible to deal with a loss of a UAV. The big amount of data produced by the UAVs requires high date rate connectivity, therefore the free space optical (FSO) communication is suitable. When using FSO links some important issues need be considered, the beam attenuation due the atmosphere on one side and the alignment of the FSO units on the other side. The alignment raises technical challenges in tracking and acquisition. The combination of UAVs with the FSO communication is an interesting investigative scenario and some of the important aspects of this ambitious design are the main focus of this paper.</abstract><custom3>2007 9th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

We propose a new end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach to UAV-enabled data collection from Internet of Things (IoT) devices in an urban environment. An autonomous drone is tasked with gathering data from distributed sensor nodes subject to limited flying time and obstacle avoidance. While previous approaches, learning and non-learning based, must perform expensive recomputations or relearn a behavior when important scenario parameters such as the number of sensors, sensor positions, or maximum flying time, change, we train a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with combined experience replay to learn a UAV control policy that generalizes over changing scenario parameters. By exploiting a multi-layer map of the environment fed through convolutional network layers to the agent, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agent to make movement decisions for a variety of scenario parameters that balance the data collection goal with flight time efficiency and safety constraints. Considerable advantages in learning efficiency from using a map centered on the UAV's position over a non-centered map are also illustrated.</abstract><custom3>GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S. -C.

Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise.</abstract><custom3>2019 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

A rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) user and multiple ground users (GUEs) are served by ground base stations (GBSs) by utilizing the uplink NOMA protocol. The UAV is dispatched to upload specific information bits to each target GBSs. Specifically, our goal is to minimize the UAV mission completion time by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and UAV-GBS association order while taking into account the UAV's interference to non-associated GBSs. The formulated problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem and involves infinite variables. To tackle this problem, we efficiently check the feasibility of the formulated problem by utilizing graph theory and topology theory. Next, we prove that the optimal UAV trajectory needs to satisfy the fly-hover-fly structure. With this insight, we first design an efficient solution with predefined hovering locations by leveraging graph theory techniques. Furthermore, we propose an iterative UAV trajectory design by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, which is guaranteed to coverage to a locally optimal solution. We demonstrate that the two proposed designs exhibit polynomial time complexity. Finally, numerical results show that: 1) the SCA based design outperforms the fly-hover-fly based design; 2) the UAV mission completion time is significantly minimized with proposed NOMA schemes compared with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; 3) the increase of GUEs' quality of service (QoS) requirements will increase the UAV mission completion time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Leader-followers formation is a widely used swarm management scenario where a leader drone frequently broadcasts controlling messages to all follower drones to achieve collaboratively a common mission. However, managing such a UAV swarm, especially when the member drones dynamically join and leave the swarm, introduces significant security challenges and performance overhead.In this work, we propose a Swarm Broadcast Protocol (SBP) to facilitate the security protection of leader-followers formation based UAV swarms. SBP contains a security key management scheme that manages a broadcast key among the swarm for leader to broadcast encrypted messages to followers. When swarm membership changes, the broadcast key will be updated and synchronized among the swarm to maintain both backward and forward secrecy. The overhead of SBP is small that only constant computational overhead is needed for both swarm leader and followers to achieve key synchronization when a new drone joins regardless of the current swarm size. This feature would highly reduce the overhead when there are many individual drone joining events. Through experiments on network emulator, we show that SBP achieves lowest bandwidth overhead and CPU utilization to handle multiple swarm membership changing events, comparing with two public-key-based swarm management protocol baselines.</abstract><custom3>2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Initial incorrect partitioning may influence the overall quality of the final architecture. In this paper Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based meta-heuristic methodologies has been tried for solving 3D IC partitioning problems. The proposed methodology minimizes number of Through Silicon Vias (TSV) and reduces heat dissipation in 3D IC partitioning. Large number of TSVs increases the chip area. Thus TSV minimization has an important role in 3D IC partitioning. Due to enhanced technology scaling and an increasing number of components with higher frequency, 3D chips have substantially higher power densities. The chip's performance and dependability are influenced by the heat dissipated by the employed power. The proposed method is also capable for reducing the heat dissipation of the entire chip. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using 3D-IC benchmark and the performance is compared with existing method. The experimental result shows that the proposed technique improves number of TSVs and required implementation area by up to 14.45% and 10.69% respectively with respect to existing method.</abstract><custom3>2022 First International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies (ICEEICT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Given their ability to explore difficult terrain in short spans of time, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become an increasingly valuable aid to search and rescue operations. Traditionally, UAVs utilize exhaustive lawnmower exploration patterns to locate stranded survivors, without any information regarding the survivor's whereabouts. In real life disaster scenarios however, on-ground observers provide valuable information to the rescue effort, such as the survivor's last known location and heading. In earlier work, a Weight Based Exploration (WBE) model, which utilizes this information to generate a prioritized list of waypoints to aid the UAV in its search mission, was proposed. This approach was shown to be effective for a single UAV locating a single survivor. In this paper, we extend the WBE model to a team of UAVs locating multiple survivors. The model initially partitions the search environment amongst the UAVs using Voronoi cells. The UAVs then utilize the WBE model to locate survivors in their partitions. We test this model with varying survivor locations and headings. We demonstrate the scalability of the model developed by testing the model with aerial teams comprising several UAVs.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N.

Secondly, the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function containing the distance term are defined, and the potential field function between the UAVs considering the influence of communication is designed to realize the control objectives of UAV collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and smoothly reaching the target point.

Applications such as signal tracking or dynamic object tracking with multiple UAVs allow a cost-effective and minimum-risk alternative to missions which have been historically handled with manned aircraft. As such, for these specific applications, we have developed a micro-avionics architecture structured around an in-house customized open-source autopilot and an indigenous Linux based single board payload/flight management computer. The essential 5-km range telemetry and control link radio is backed up by high-power long-range IEEE 802.11n (WiFi) radio device. The redundancy of communication not only improves the reliability of the avionics architecture, but also enables the trade-off between bandwidth and power efficiency. The architecture is capable of transmitting data at rates above 200 kbps up to 4 km away from its ground station equipped with the developed miniature patch antenna tracker. The payload/flight management computer is ready to run a CSI/USB connected day-light or low-illumination infra-red camera, a USB connected software defined radio and different types of sensor payloads such as radar/lidar range sensors and RGBD cameras. Tied to this architecture, we have designed a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing system with MAVlink communication protocol interlinking hardware to Matlab based UAV dynamic models and tracking algorithms. This system allows comprehensive simulation and testing of designed control and guidance algorithms before flight tests while minimizing cost and crash risk.

The research is principally motivated by the need for offline and online motion planning for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For UAVs operating in large dynamic uncertain 4-D environments, the motion plan consists of a sequence of connected linear tracks (or trajectory segments). The track angle and velocity are important parameters that are often restricted by assumptions and a grid geometry in conventional motion planners. Many existing planners also fail to incorporate multiple decision criteria and constraints such as wind, fuel, dynamic obstacles, and the rules of the air. It is shown that MSA* finds a cost optimal solution using variable length, angle, and velocity trajectory segments. These segments are approximated with a grid-based cell sequence that provides an inherent tolerance to uncertainty. The computational efficiency is achieved by using variable successor operators to create a multiresolution memory-efficient lattice sampling structure. The simulation studies on the UAV flight planning problem show that MSA* meets the time constraints of online replanning and finds paths of equivalent cost but in a quarter of the time (on average) of a vector neighborhood-based A*.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

With the great capability of friendly uses and wide applications for multiple purposes, amateur drones can be piloted to effortlessly access any geographical area. This poses some difficulties in monitoring and managing drones that may invade private or limited-access areas. In this paper, we propose a radio-frequency (RF)-based surveillance solution to effectively detect and classify drones, and recognize operations by leveraging a high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed network, namely RF-UAVNet, is specified with grouped one-dimensional convolution to significantly reduce the network size and computational cost. Besides, a novel structure of multi-level skip-connection, for the preservation of gradient flow, incorporating multi-level pooling, for the collection of informative deep features, is proposed to achieve high accuracy via learning efficiency improvement. In the experiments, RF-UAVNet yields the accuracy of 99.85% for drone detection, 98.53% for drone classification, and 95.33% for operation mode recognition, numbers which outperform the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods on DroneRF, a publicly available dataset for RF-based drone surveillance systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

At the first level of hierarchy, we aggregate the high-dimensional control system of the swarm into a small-dimensional control system capturing its essential features. These features describe the position of the swarm in the world and its size. At the second level, we reduce the problem of controlling the essential features of the swarm to a model-checking problem. In the obtained hierarchical framework, high-level specifications given in natural language, such as linear temporal logic formulas over linear predicates in the essential features, are automatically mapped to provably correct robot control laws. For the particular case of an abstraction based on centroid and variance, we show that swarm cohesion, interrobot collision avoidance, and environment containment can also be specified and automatically guaranteed in our framework.

It can be classified for the purpose of its deployment, either in the civilian or military domain. The earliest usage of drones was totally for military purposes, but manufacturers promptly tested it for civilian fields like border surveillance, disaster relief, pipeline inspection, and rescue. Drone manufacturing, equipment installation, power supply, multi-rotor system, and embedded sensors are not the pressing issues for researchers of drone technologies. What is required is to utilize a drone for a complex operation and ensure secured data broadcasting among drones with the ground control station via a self-organized, resourceless, and infrastructureless network (Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs)). These operations are no less important in areas like an emergency, search and rescue operations, border surveillance, and physical phenomenon sensing for the end-user. However, it is not without some challenges for the researchers keeping in view the threats these operations are exposed to concerning security issues and challenges. To overcome these challenges, the researchers have to strive towards a secured drone operation by developing a robust and lightweight key agreement protocol for IoD deployment civilian drones. Consequently, the researchers in this study have attempted to design a key agreement scheme for the IoD deployment of civilian drones. The security of the proposed key agreement scheme has been verified by ProVerif2.02 and Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, while its performance scenario has been tackled by considering storage, computation, and communication overheads analysis. In comparing the proposed framework with prior protocols, it has been demonstrated that the scheme is quite efficient and may be recommended for operations in a given IoD environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Existing detectors based on deep-learning methods usually apply the feature extraction networks with a large down-sampling factor to obtain higher-level features. However, such big stride tends to make the feature information of small objects become the little point or even vanish in the low-resolution feature maps due to the limitation of pixels. Therefore, a novel structure called Multi-branch Parallel Feature Pyramid Networks (MPFPN) is proposed in this article, which aims to extract more abundant feature information of the objects with a small size. Specifically, the parallel branch is designed to recover the features that missed in the deeper layers. Meanwhile, a supervised spatial attention module (SSAM) is applied to weaken the impact of background noise inference and focus object information. Furthermore, we adopt cascade architecture in the Fast R-CNN stage for a more powerful localization capability. Experiments on the public drone-based datasets named VisDrone-DET demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art detection algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and protocols provide a standard network layer among these varying scenarios and mitigate many challenges of the space environment, such as long delays, unplanned service interruptions, and asymmetric links. The Cognitive Space Gateway (CSG) is a routing method in a DTN architecture that uses spiking neural networks as the learning element to optimize routing decisions in a complex environment.This work aims to further develop cognitive networking technologies in several critical areas, including DTN, the CSG algorithm, SmallSat swarm topologies, and cloud services. The CSG algorithm is tested in a realistic scenario in which the emulated network topology is based on a SmallSat swarm. The emulation environment will be built upon a commercial cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud. This work investigates the ability of such a platform to enable a flexible, lower maintenance approach to creating a multi-hop network outside of a physical laboratory.

In the cloud computing architecture, the data generated by ground users (GUs) can be offloaded to the remote server for fast processing. However, the heterogeneity of mobile tasks makes the data size distributed among GUs unbalanced. Besides, the energy efficiency of UAVs movement should be carefully considered for sustainable flight and obstacle avoidance. In general, such a joint trajectory issue can hardly be formulated as a convex optimization in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper proposes a potential game combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize multiple UAVs' trajectory with the consideration of GUs' offloading delay, energy efficiency as well as obstacle avoidance system. In specific, we first model the issue as a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINP), in which the service assignment between multi-user and multi-UAV is solved by potential game. The convergence to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) can be achieved by distributive service assignment update with infinite iteration. Then, we optimize the trajectory with obstacle avoidance at each UAV by MADDPG approach, which has a great advantage of centralized-training and decentralized-execution to reduce the global synchronized communication overhead. UAVs movement can be optimized in continuity rather than other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches generating discrete simple actions. Experiments demonstrate the proposed game-combined learning algorithm can minimize the offloading delay, enhance UAVs’ energy efficiency and avoid the obstacles at the same time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The steerable Yagi antenna consists of 3 elements lying on an FR4 substrate that form an angle with the CubeSat's surface. The key idea is to mechanically control the angle between the proposed antenna and the CubeSat's surface to achieve steerability and hence establish inter-satellite link. A scanning angle of 60 degrees can be achieved which could potentially support a variety of CubeSat missions. The proposed antenna was simulated using HFSS to show its steerability and S11 and radiation pattern measurements were carried out. The simulation results show that the antenna provides a maximum gain of 8.877dB and reflection coefficient of -16.73dB at 2.45GHz with a -10dB bandwidth of 250MHz. The measured reflection coefficient is -14.6dB with -10dB bandwidth of 200 MHz at a resonant frequency of 2.45GHz.

The path planning of a single UAV and multiple UAV cooperative formation tracking of a moving target is studied. First, the feedback control is used to ensure heading convergence for the path planning of a single UAV. Furthermore, we use a variable airspeed controller to achieve the desired angular spacing and build the information architecture using graph theory for the UAV formation tracking of moving targets.

Edge computing resources deployed near crop fields support autonomous agents with substantial computational needs for tasks such as AI inference. In large fields, using multiple autonomous agents, called swarms, can speed up crop management tasks if sufficient edge resources are provisioned. However, to use swarms today, farmers and software developers craft their own standalone solutions that are either simple and ineffective or complicated and hard-to-reproduce. We present MARbLE, a platform for developing and managing swarms. MARbLE provides an easy-to-use programming paradigm that helps users build swarm workloads using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Developers supply just two functions Map() and Eval(). The platform automatically compiles and deploys swarms and continuously updates the reinforcement learning models that govern their actions. Developers can experiment with multiple swarm and edge resource configurations both in simulation and with actual in-field runs. We studied real UAV swarms conducting digital agriculture missions. We observe that swarms demanded edge computing resources in bursts; the ratio of average to peak demand was 2.9X. MARbLE uses energy-saving load balancing policies to duty cycle machines during workload demand troughs, leveraging workload patterns to save edge energy. Using MARbLE, we found that four-agent swarms with load balancing techniques sped up missions by 2.1X and reduced edge energy usage by up to 2X compared to state of the art autonomous swarms.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE/ACM 7th Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition to interacting with the environment, can also communicate with each other over a noisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered explicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment, and the message each agent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the agents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate “effectively” over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the traditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message reliably over a noisy channel, and the “learning to communicate” framework that has received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying communication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that the joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where the communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP. This is a very powerful framework, which has many real world applications, from autonomous vehicle planning to drone swarm control, and opens up the rich toolbox of deep reinforcement learning for the design of multi-user communication systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

We bring to bear the notion of group feedback (gNACK/gACK) for broadcast/multicast transmissions, where an ACK/NACK is determined not on a peruser, or per-packet basis, but instead, based on multiple users, and multiple packets. We formulate this problem as a submodular optimization problem to obtain optimal solutions, and algorithms in minimizing the sum-rate for determining the gNACK (gACK) under the assumption that each user in the swarm is aware of the error rates of all other users. We then extend the structure of the optimal algorithm to devise distributed group feedback protocols, where a user operates solely on its own error rates, and does not possess information on error rates of other users. We show that the proposed distributed group feedback protocol is ≈ 1.5% away from the optimal solution. PHY/MAC system design aspects of the group feedback protocols regarding cellular systems are outlined. Simulation results assessing the performance of the proposed protocols are provided. With the goal of embracing the evolving perspective of UAVs to swarming use cases, where a network of UAVs cooperate to accomplish a mission are envisioned, this study becomes important as it enables spectrally efficient feedback, and local packet loss recovery schemes, without invoking the base station.</abstract><custom3>2018 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The CAT is a real-time testbed built on the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) architecture that integrates five and six degree-of-freedom dynamic models of up to 64 Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS) wide area search weapons, with mission planning tools, models of the release aircraft, a simulation of wireless communication between weapons via 802.11b type protocols, and a synchronous unmanned aircraft in-the-loop. The goals of cooperative attack include enhancing weapon performance and increasing battlefield situational awareness. By sharing information on their own states and the state of their observations, weapons or UAVs may re-plan trajectories in-flight, determine what targets to attack, and increase the probability of target detection and classification. The weapon or UAV entities may also exchange sensor information with off-board sensors and control authorities.

ANTS design principles draw on successes observed in the realm of social insect colonies, which include task specialization and sociality. ANTS spacecraft act as independent, autonomous agents for specific functions, while cooperating to achieve mission goals. For example, the Prospecting ANTS Mission (PAM) is a long-term mission concept for the 2020-2025 time frame involving individual spacecraft agents that are optimized for specific asteroid prospecting functions. The objective of PAM is to characterize at least one thousand asteroids during each year of operations in the main belt. To achieve this objective, PAM spacecraft, individually and as a group, must achieve a high level of autonomy. This high degree of autonomy opens the possibility of a new kind of interaction between humans and these spacecraft, where human explorers and developers could interact with ANTS enabled resources by communicating high-level goals and data products. Thus ANTS enables new kinds of missions in which human and robotic agents work together to achieve mission goals. In this paper we review and discuss the ANTS architecture in the context of the HEDS mission.</abstract><custom3>2003 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings (Cat.

Each robot may have homogeneous or heterogeneous capabilities and can be programmed with several fundamental control laws adapting to the environment. Through different kinds of relationships built using the communication protocols, they present various behaviors based on the shared information and current state. To adapt to dynamic environments effectively, and maximize the utility of the group, robots need to cooperate, share their local information, and make a suitable plan according to the specific scenario. In this paper, we formalize the problem of multi-robots fulfilling dynamic tasks using state transitions represented through a Behavior Tree.

Design of such systems requires knowledge of the flight dynamics of UAVs and the communication links connecting UAVs with each other or with the ground control station. Besides, UAV networks are dynamic and distinctive from other ad-hoc networks and require protocols that can adapt to high-mobility, dynamic topology and changing link quality in power constrained resource platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to co-design the UAV path planning algorithms and the communication protocols. The proposed co-simulation framework integrates existing tools to simulate flight dynamics and network related aspects. Gazebo with robot operating system (ROS) is used as a physical system UAV simulator and NS-3 is used as a network simulator, to jointly capture the cyber-physical system (CPS) aspects of the multi-UAV systems. A particular aspect we address is on synchronizing time and position across the two simulation environments, and we provide APIs to allow easy migration of the algorithms to real platforms.</abstract><custom3>2020 International Conference on COMmunication Systems &amp; NETworkS (COMSNETS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

The initial goal has been to create a simulation environment in which existing routing protocols from the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) areas can be evaluated in these types of networks. To show its capabilities, we performed simulations of the planned satellite constellations of Starlink and Telesat based on publicly available parameters. Through simulations of Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), we were able to gain valuable insights into the unique challenges presented to these protocols by satellite networks. It is unlikely that existing ad-hoc protocols using distance-vector routing or flooding can be used for broadband internet connectivity and alternative methods of handling large-scale mobility in these networks are needed. However, with ns-3-leo a much needed extension for supporting the development of protocols fulfilling the needs of satellite constellations is provided.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Specifically, we aim to minimize deployment and operational costs, with respect to budget and power constraints. To this end, we first optimize the number and locations of cluster heads (CHs) guaranteeing data collection from all sensors. Then, to minimize the data collection flight time, we optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. Accordingly, we distinguish two trajectory approaches: 1) where a UAV hovers exactly above the visited CH; and 2) where a UAV hovers within a range of the CH. The results of this include guidelines for data collection design. The characteristics of sensor nodes' K-means clustering are then discussed. Next, we illustrate the performance of optimal and heuristic solutions for trajectory planning. The genetic algorithm is shown to be near- optimal with only 3:5% degradation. The impacts of the trajectory approach, environment, and UAVs' altitude are investigated. Finally, fairness of UAVs trajectories is discussed.</abstract><custom3>2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

UAVs are also enabler in wireless communication that has potential features such as ubiquitous and reliable connectivity, fast and easy deployment, adaptive altitude, higher chance of line of sight (LOS) propagation path, higher mobility and flexibility. There are numerous surveys that summarized these advantages for different situations and scenarios. However, none of these surveys discussed the role of UAVs in public safety communications from the energy efficiency perspective. In this paper, we review the existing literature for UAV communication with taking into account the energy consumption criteria, and propose a multi-layered network architecture incorporating UAVs for public safety communication.

In this paper, we study UAV deployment problem in an integrated access and backhaul network, where a number of UAVs are deployed as aerial base stations (ABSs) or aerial relays (ARs) to forward GUs’ data packets to the remote gateway via multi-hop transmissions. Aiming at minimizing the system cost, which is defined as the weighted sum of UAV deployment cost and the energy consumption required for data transmission, a constrained system cost minimization problem is formulated, where UAV deployment, GU association and route selection problem are optimized. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we propose a two-stage heuristic algorithm. In the first stage, we focus on the optimal design of the access links and propose a joint ABS deployment and resource allocation algorithm. Specifically, a modified K-means based clustering scheme is proposed to determine ABS deployment and GU association strategy. Given the obtained ABS deployment strategy, in the second stage, we then design a joint AR deployment, route selection scheme for the backhaul links and propose a minimum circle algorithm-based AR deployment and route selection strategy.

However, due to their low-gravity, variable sizes and shapes, dedicated orbiting spacecraft missions around these target bodies is difficult. Therefore, many planetary bodies are observed during flyby encounters, and consequently, the mapping coverage of the target body is limited. In this work, we propose the use of a spacecraft swarm to provide complete surface maps of a planetary body during a close encounter flyby. With the advancement of low-cost spacecraft technology, such a swarm can be realized by using multiple miniature spacecraft. The design of a swarm mission is a complex multi-disciplinary problem. To get started, we propose the Integrated Design Engineering &amp; Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software. In this work, we will introduce the development of the Automated Swarm Designer module of the software. The Automated Swarm Designer module will use evolutionary algorithms to optimize the design of swarms. The designed swarm will use 2 attitude control strategies to map the surface of a target body, namely: Nadir Pointing (NP), and Field of View Sweeping (FoV Sweeping). In the former strategy, the spacecraft are commanded to passively observe the sub-satellite point on the target body whenever the target is in the field of view of the individual spacecraft. This strategy is used when the observing instrument on board the spacecraft is large enough to capture the target from the desired encounter distance. In case the instrument is not large enough, then the spacecraft will have to maneuver their field of view to improve the coverage. The Field of View Sweeping strategy describes one such maneuver to improve coverage. In this strategy, the spacecraft in the swarm are commanded to sweep their fields of view about their principal axis normal to the swarm plane. The current work addresses different aspects of the swarm design problem. First, the coverage problem is addressed, and the parameters: instrument size, and target flyby distance are determined. Following this, the modeling of the swarm is described, where the individual spacecraft are arranged to define a circular plane around the target body during the encounter. Then the encounter trajectories of the spacecraft swarm are modeled. Here a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme using the state transition matrix of the dynamics is proposed for the entire swarm, which finds the trajectories between the desired starting points and destination points of the spacecraft within a specified flyby duration. Following this, the two proposed attitude control strategies are then described as they occur on these flyby trajectories. Then the design of these swarms is presented using as 2 optimization problems. The proposed strategies are used to develop a numerical simulator which will serve as the Automated Swarm Designer module of IDEAS for visual mapping missions. Finally, the simulator developed is demonstrated by designing a swarm using genetic algorithms for a visual mapping mission of asteroid 433 Eros.</abstract><custom3>2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

However, the signals from multiple RF sources are aggregated at the airborne sensors, making it hard to achieve multi-emitter localization with a limited number of UAVs. In this paper, the Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) approach is applied to estimating ground targets’ locations exploiting the RSS data collected by the onboard sensors. Meanwhile, to support the BCS approach, which requires sufficient measurements to achieve multi-emitter localization, a sensing architecture comprising a limited number of UAVs is presented. Besides, to optimize the localization result, we put forward a trajectory planning-based Bayesian compressive sensing (TPBCS) algorithm. This algorithm dynamically plans UAVs’ trajectories based on the adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) algorithm, which can bring down the computational cost in UAV path planning compared to the traditional simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The effectiveness and robustness of the approach are validated by simulations in the end.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

However, how to reduce the maximum sidelobe level (SLL) of the beam pattern is a key problem in antenna arrays. In this paper, three kinds of antenna arrays that are linear antenna array (LAA), circular antenna array (CAA) and random antenna array (RAA) are investigated. First, we formulate the SLL suppression optimization problems of LAA, CAA and RAA, respectively. Then, we propose a novel method called improved chicken swarm optimization (ICSO) approach to solve the formulated optimization problems. ICSO introduces four enhanced strategies including the local search factor, weighting factor and global search factor into the update method of conventional chicken swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm, respectively, for achieving better beam pattern optimization results of antenna arrays. Moreover, a variation mechanism is proposed to enhance the population diversity so that further improving the performance of the algorithm. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed ICSO for the maximum SLL suppressions of LAAs, CAAs and RAAs, and the results show that ICSO obtains lower maximum SLLs for different antenna array cases with different numbers of antenna elements compared to several other algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

The presented approach takes into account the human hand velocity and changes the formation shape and dynamics accordingly using impedance interlinks simulated between quadrotors, which helps to achieve a natural swarm behavior. Several tactile patterns representing static and dynamic parameters of the swarm are proposed. The user feels the state of the swarm at the fingertips and receives valuable information to improve the controllability of the complex formation. A user study revealed the patterns with high recognition rates. A flight experiment demonstrated the possibility to accurately navigate the formation in a cluttered environment using only tactile feedback. Subjects stated that tactile sensation allows guiding the drone formation through obstacles and makes the human-swarm communication more interactive. The proposed technology can potentially have a strong impact on the human-swarm interaction, providing a higher level of awareness during the swarm navigation.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

However, flying several UAVs at once poses many challenges to safely and efficiently localizing and monitoring them. Further, they need to maintain their formation distance to avoid collision between team members and any environmental obstacles. Besides, SUAVs are mainly equipped with an on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to obtain their positions, but they are not accurate enough and suffer from several vulnerabilities that restrict their applications. Thus, in GPS-denied situations, the acquisition of the positions of UAVs can be assisted by alternative technologies and solutions. This paper is one of the foremost in-depth works that present the topic of localization of SUAVs from various perspectives including current research challenges on positioning systems, telecommunication, and path planning, along with future opportunities on automated delivery services such as medicine, remote inspection of industrial sites, and precision agriculture.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

In particular, we consider a swarm of hovering UAVs that relays information from a terrestrial base station to a distant mobile user and simultaneously generates friendly jamming signals to interfere/obfuscate an eavesdropper. Due to the limited energy of the UAVs, we develop a collaborative time-switching relaying protocol that allows the UAVs to collaborate in harvesting wireless energy, relay information, and jam the eavesdropper. To evaluate the performance, we derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for two popular detection techniques at the eavesdropper, i.e., selection combining and maximum-ratio combining. Monte Carlo simulations are then used to validate the theoretical SOP derivation. Using the derived SOP, one can obtain engineering insights to optimize the EH time and the number of UAVs in the swarm to achieve a given secrecy protection level. Furthermore, simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of SOP compared to the conventional AF relaying system. The analytical SOP derived in this work can also be helpful in future UAV secure-communication optimizations (e.g., trajectory and locations of UAVs). As an example, we present a case study to find the optimal corridor to locate the swarm so as to minimize the system SOP. Our proposed framework helps secure communications for various applications that require large coverage, e.g., industrial IoT, smart city, intelligent transportation systems, and critical IoT infrastructures, such as energy and water.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Compared to the traditional ad-hoc networks, FANETs are more efficient in completing their task in catastrophic situations to deliver data communication services from the height. However, type of the mission and sensitivity of the application requires an adaptive, efficient, and scalable communication network for data transmission among the UAVs. Such network are challenged by the high mobility and frequent topology changes, resulting connectivity loss problem. In this context, the UAVs in FANETs have been deployed with omnidirectional antennas, which leads to restrict the overall performance of the network. Alternately, directional antennas have the potential to enhance the transmission range, spatial reuse, and capacity of the network effectively. Nevertheless, these benefits also bring some unique challenges, particularly for the MAC layer. In order to overcome such constraints, we propose a new directional antennas based medium access control (MAC) protocol to adapt the FANETs architecture. The idea is to use multiple directional antennas on a single UAV with IEEE 802.11 protocol. The design goal is to improve the overall performance of the network and to provide solutions to some of the unique challenges of using directional antennas. The integrated solution is modeled in OPNET and evaluated for throughput, end-to-end delay, and retransmission attempts. The simulation results authenticate that the proposed IEEE 802.11-based directional antennas protocol could significantly increase the performance of FANETs as compared to omnidirectional antennas.</abstract><custom3>2018 5th International Multi-Topic ICT Conference (IMTIC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

For example, the wireless sensor network with backscatter communication technology can monitor the environment in remote areas without battery maintenance or replacement. Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter communication is limited. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-UAV-aided data collection scenario where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fly close to the backscatter sensor node (BSN) to activate it and then collects the data. We aim to minimize the total flight time of the rechargeable UAVs when the collection mission is finished. During the data collection process, the UAVs can return to the charging station to recharge itself when the energy of UAV is not sufficient to complete the mission. To reduce the complexity of the task, we first use the Gaussian mixture model clustering method to divide the BSNs into multiple clusters. Then we consider the deterministic boundary and ambiguous boundary for the UAV flying regions, respectively. For the deterministic boundary scenario, we propose a single-agent deep option learning (SADOL) algorithm, where each UAV cannot fly beyond the deterministic boundary. For the ambiguous boundary scenario, we propose a multiagent deep option learning (MADOL) algorithm to enable the UAVs to cooperatively learn the ambiguous BSNs assignment. In the simulation, we compare the proposed algorithms with multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and deep Q-network (DQN) algorithms, which proves the proposed algorithms can achieve better performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

During the hovering periods, the UAV works on full-duplex mode to simultaneously collect data from the target device and charge other devices within its coverage. Practical propulsion power consumption model and non-linear energy harvesting model are taken into account. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize three objectives: maximization of sum data rate, maximization of total harvested energy and minimization of UAV's energy consumption over a particular mission period. These three objectives are in conflict with each other partly and weight parameters are given to describe associated importance. Since IoT devices keep gathering information from the physical surrounding environment and their requirements to upload data change dynamically, online path planning of the UAV is required. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve online decision. An extended deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn control policies of UAV over multiple objectives. While training, the agent learns to produce optimal policies under given weights conditions on the basis of achieving timely data collection according to the requirement priority and avoiding devices' data overflow. The verification results show that the proposed MODDPG (multi-objective DDPG) algorithm achieves joint optimization of three objectives and optimal policies can be adjusted according to weight parameters among optimization objectives.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

One critical aspect to enable the use of such vehicles is the coordination/planning system, whose task complexity increases with the number of vehicles and the communications constraints that arise due to their small size and large distances. In this work, we propose a control architecture for a platoon of relay UAVs that are independent of the coordination system. The platoon task consists in interconnecting the communication link between the possibly mobile command station and a UAV in a mission. The relays are actively driven to deploy, create a network and maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. We present an architecture that is composed by a waypoint generator based on the network QoS and a Time Coordinated Path Following (TCPF) controller with a method to reduce the frequency of information exchange between the relay UAVs, through the use of a self-triggered control strategy. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a mission operation for a UAV without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the relay-UAVs platoon. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the developed strategy. The self-triggered approach results in significant reduction of information exchange between the relay UAVs, while maintaining the user desired network QoS.</abstract><custom3>2017 Workshop on Research, Education and Development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (RED-UAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

In this paper, we investigate the planning process for a 5G radio access network having mmWave Micro Remote Radio Units (mRRUs) on top of sub-6 GHz Macro Remote Radio Units (MRRUs). We rely on proper channel models and link budgets as well as Urban Macro-cells (UMa) and Urban Micro-cells (UMi) characteristics to carefully formulate a 5G network planning optimization problem. We aim to jointly determine the minimum number of MRRUs and mRRUs to install and find their locations in a given geographical area while fulfilling coverage and user traffic demand constraints. In order to solve this planning process, we propose a two-step process where we first employ a low complexity meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the locations of RRUs followed by an iterative elimination method to remove redundant cells. To evaluate the performances of this proposed approach, we conduct a comparative study using Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing. Simulations results using sub-6 GHz UMa and 28 GHz UMi demonstrate the ability of the proposed planning approach to achieve more than 98% coverage with minimum cell capacity outage rate, not exceeding the 2%, for different scenarios and illustrate the efficiency of the evolutionary algorithms in solving this NP-hard problem in reasonable running time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Technological advances in this field have made it possible to coordinate the flight of these aircraft so as to conform a swarm. A UAV swarm is defined as a group of UAVs working collaboratively to carry out more complex missions or perform tasks more efficiently. Common applications of these swarms include rescue missions, precision agriculture, and border control, among others. However, there are still certain problems that prevent us from ensuring the success of their mission, especially as the number of drones in a swarm increases. In this paper, we specifically address the problem of a swarm take-off by optimizing the total time involved, while guaranteeing the safety of the UAVs during the take-off stage. To this end, we propose a new approach that combines a collision detection algorithm based on trajectory analysis with a batch generation mechanism that we use in order to determine the take-off sequence. Experiments show that our algorithm offers an efficient solution, managing to improve the performance of existing take-off techniques.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

The application of ecodriving initiatives in lines equipped with automatic train operation (ATO) systems can provide important savings with low investments. Previous studies carried out under the ATO framework have not considered the main uncertainties in the traffic operation: the train load and delays in the line. This paper proposes a method to design robust and efficient speed profiles to be programmed in the ATO equipment of a metro line. First, an optimal Pareto front for ATO speed profiles that are robust to changes in train load is constructed. There are two objectives: running time and energy consumption. A robust optimization technique and an alternative method based on the conservation of the shape of the speed profiles (pattern robustness) are compared. Both procedures make use of a multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then, the set of speed profiles to be programmed in the ATO equipment is selected from the robust Pareto front by means of an optimization model. This model is a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to minimize the total energy consumption considering the statistical information about delays in the line. This procedure has been applied to a case study. The results showed that the pattern robustness is more restrictive and meaningful than the robust optimization technique as it provides information about shapes that are more comfortable for passengers. In addition, the use of statistical information about delays provides additional energy savings between 3% and 14%.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Here, the satellite delivers signal to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through a FSO link subject to Gamma-Gamma distributed turbulence, while the UAV forwards the decoded signal to multiple users through RF links characterzied by the correlated Rayleigh fading channel. By adopting that the selective decode-and-forward (DF) protocol at the UAV, we derive a closed-form expression for ergodic capacity (EC) of the considered system, where the RF link exploits transmit beamforming (BF) based on statistical channel state information (CSI) to obtain better performance than single antenna scenarios in existing works. Then, with the help of the derived EC and the available statistical CSI, a novel proportional fair scheduling (PFS) scheme is proposed. Finally, numerical results are conducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed scheduling scheme.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

However, most existing routing protocols for UAV networks aim at unicast routing, and there are few multicast protocols dedicated to UAV networks. Furthermore, most existing multicast protocols for mobile wireless networks usually maintain a forwarding structure, and they are inefficient in UAV networks due to the unique characteristics of UAVs, such as high-speed movement and sparse distribution. For many UAV applications, the trajectories of UAVs are pre-planned in advance through mission planning and trajectory planning, and the location and motion information of UAVs can be obtained through positioning technology and inertial sensors. In this paper, we propose an efficient Trajectory-Based Multicast (TBM) routing protocol for UAV networks. TBM utilizes the trajectory information to compute the encounters between UAVs, then a priority metric that characterizes the ability of a UAV to forward a message to multiple destination nodes is calculated. Based on the priority metric, TBM constructs a priority encounter graph, which considers the timeliness and stability of message forwarding, thus finding a multicast forwarding sequence with low delay and high delivery ratio. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TBM.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE 22nd International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 18th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 6th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X. -c.

However, the problem of planning an energy-efficient path for the surveillance purpose while anticipating disturbances and predicting energy consumptions during the path tracking is still a challenging problem in recent years. The optimal path planning and the disturbance rejection control for a UAV surveillance system are investigated in this paper. A trained and tested energy consumption regression model is used to be the cost function of an optimal path planning scheme, which is designed from a clustered 3D real pilot flight pattern with the proposed K-agglomerative clustering method, and is processed via A-star and set-based particle-swarm-optimization (S-PSO) algorithm with adaptive weights. Moreover, an online adaptive neural network (ANN) controller with varied learning rates is designed to ensure the control stability while having a reliably fast disturbance rejection response. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified by numerical simulations and experimental results. By applying the proposed optimal path planning scheme, the energy consumption of the optimal path is only 72.3397 Wh while the average consumed energy of real pilot flight data is 96.593Wh. In addition, the proposed ANN control improves average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of horizontal and vertical tracking performance by 49.083% and 37.50% in comparison with a proportional-integral-differential (PID) control and a fuzzy control under the occurrence of external disturbances. According to all of the results, the combination of the proposed optimal path planning scheme and ANN controller can achieve an energy-efficient UAV surveillance systems with fast disturbance rejection response.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

Clustering technique is one of the methods utilized to extend lifetime of the network by applying data aggregation and balancing energy consumption among sensor nodes of the network. In this paper, we propose the recently developed, Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for minimizing the intra-cluster distance and optimizing the energy consumption of the network. HSA is music based meta-heuristic optimization method which is analogous with the music improvisation process where musician continue to polish the pitches in order to obtain better harmony. A comparison is made with the well known cluster-based protocol approach developed for WSNs known as Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), heuristic optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm(GA) as well as the traditional K-means and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithms.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clustering is a significant technology in FANETs. In each cluster, the cluster head (CH) is responsible for cluster management. However, due to the frequent movement and limited energy of UAVs, one of the foremost challenges in FANETs is unstable communication performance of cluster. Hence, to cope with this issue, we propose a Mobility Aware Clustering scheme based on Swarm Intelligence (MACSI) for FANETs, which is enlightened by animal collective behavior. More specifically, the modified glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm based on chaos strategy is put forward for CH selection and cluster formation. It aims to help UAVs cooperate with each other to conduct missions and change their positions accordingly. In addition, a stable CH selection mechanism depends on energy, position and the movement relationship. Our proposal has been evaluated with respect to metrics as energy consumption and cluster life time. The experimental results obtained validate that, the proposed scheme has less energy consumption and extended cluster life time compared with existing clustering schemes.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V.

This paper presents a novel Hungarian-based approach to challenging multi-task allocation (MTA) problems, where the number of UAVs is smaller than the number of tasks. We developed the Cluster-Based Hungarian Algorithm (CBHA), in which (1) tasks are grouped such that the number of UAVs is the same as the number of task groups, (2) the original Hungarian algorithm is applied, and (3) an algorithm for travel-salesman-problem (TSP) is applied to perform path planning for individual UAVs. The performance of the proposed CBHA was compared with the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA) in Monti Carlo simulations, where different numbers of UAVs and tasks were adopted in the scenario of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles traveling through a number of targeting locations.

In this paper, we identify scaling issues and present some simple results in the domain of individual mobile robots, as well as teams, swarms, etc., deployed on sensing missions. Since most robot-based sensing missions anticipate mini-, micro-, and nano-scale robots, our explicit examples focus on scaling-down of existing human-scale robot design and concepts. However the principles articulated apply equally to scaling-up situations. The topic is introduced via a simple example that shows why scaling-down of mobile robots that carry their own energy source will generally prove impractical: to obtain reasonable operating times it will rather be necessary to develop small robots into which energy can be beamed, or which can forage for energy sources in the environment. From this concrete illustrative example, the paper moves on to a higher level discussion of robot architecture and the applicability of scaling principles, to varying degrees, to all the modules, i.e., it is not exclusively a mobility issue. There follows a short discussion of how changes of scale are not inherently problematic, but to the contrary, in many cases suitable scale change provides the key to solving a difficult engineering problem. The final section is a quantitative example in which design and operating parameters of the robotic nodes of a sensor network are considered from the perspective of operating time limited by the energy cost of node-to-node communication. This example powerfully illustrates a system in which fairly modest changes contemplated range of engineering parameters result in enormous changes in the anticipated operating time of the system.</abstract><custom3>Proceedings of the 20th IEEE Instrumentation Technology Conference (Cat.

In this context, more than one robot must have the ability to simultaneously perform different tasks in a certain coordination and plan. In the solution of the related problem, it has been tried to ensure that the robots communicate and move in coordination over a central communication architecture. The most important handicap of central architectures is that the communication mechanism of the whole system collapses in case the related unit fails because the system is connected to a single unit. In this context, a novel decentralized architecture has been implemented and tested for physical robots.

The objective of this study is to assess the capabilities of UAV for slope mapping. This study only concentrates on multi-rotor UAV, which is known as Hexacopter. Several ground control points (GCP) and checked point (CP) were established using total station in the simulated model and slope area. GCPs were used in exterior orientation during image processing in sequence to transform image coordinates into the local coordinate system. Checkpoints were established in the simulated model and slope area for accuracy assessment. There are two types of surveys that have been applied in this study, namely, field survey, and UAV platform. Digital camera was mounted vertically at the bottom of UAV and it captured the images at low altitude. All acquired images went through all photogrammetric processing including interior orientation, exterior orientation and bundle adjustment using photogrammetric software. Two main photogrammetric results were produced, i.e digital orthophoto and digital elevation model of the simulated model and slope study area. Based on the results, it was found that the multi-rotor UAV is suited in mapping the simulated model and slope area with reliable accuracy.</abstract><custom3>2015 International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

Acting as an energy source, the UAV operates at a fixed height and transfers energy to the multiple sensor nodes (SNs) via wireless signals. For more efficient energy harvesting (EH), an antenna array has been installed on UAV with a structure of three dimensional (3D) uniform linear array (ULA), which enables the UAV to perform analog beamforming for power concentration. Taking into account the UAV energy consumption and considering a practical nonlinear EH model, we characterize the UAV energy efficiency particularly for WPT task and subsequently formulate an efficiency maximization problem, in which the analog beamforming and UAV trajectory planning are jointly determined together with the transmit power control scheme. To deal with the nonconvex joint optimization problem, we first propose a cosine-based approximation for the complicated 3D ULA antenna pattern, in which a convex property is proved. Combining with the proved convexity in nonlinear EH model, through a series of mathematical analysis, we construct a convex subproblem based on any feasible point, solving which guarantees an improvement of the energy efficiency. Afterwards, an iterative algorithm is proposed for iteratively addressing the joint design until a convergence to a suboptimal solution. Via simulations, we verify the convergence and performance advantages of our proposed iterative solution. Among the solution, different beamforming preferences regarding the beam coverage enlargement and power concentration are also observed with respect to different antenna array scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed to search for novel architectures without human intervention that can achieve comparable performance to those of human-designed architectures. This work is inspired by current neural architecture search approaches based on reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm. However, not much attention is paid towards swarm intelligence metaheuristics-based neural architecture search. A framework is proposed for automatically designing neural architectures based on a swarm intelligence metaheuristic: Crow Search Algorithm. First, Crow Search Algorithm is integrated with binary network representation. To make it compatible for Neural Architecture Search, the original distance metric is replaced with hamming distance-based similarity measure. Second, the tuning parameters of Crow Search Algorithm are reduced by replacing the static flight length parameter with our dynamic flight length distribution algorithm. Third, the target selection method (random selection) is replaced by tournament select method. The proposed framework is used to search for architectures on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets and achieved 0.18%, 3.48%, and 15.64% test error, respectively. Furthermore, small-scale transfer experiments are conducted to search architectures for Tiny ImageNet and achieved 34.43% test error. Nonparametric statistical analysis is performed to validate the impact of each modification in improving the quality of search space exploration. The proposed framework has achieved comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approaches, with a comparatively simpler approach and minimum human intervention. The proposed framework can be used to develop completely automated systems for designing architectures for various data-based classification applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

This is a principle that takes inspiration from the nature, that maximizes the possibility of monitoring the environment and therefore of anticipating risks and finding targets. In robotics, alongside these reasons, the organization of a robot team in a formation allows a human operator to deal with a high number of agents in a simpler way, moving the swarm as a single entity. In this context, the typology of visual feedback is fundamental for a correct situational awareness, but in common practice having an optimal camera configuration is not always possible. Usually human operators use cameras on board the multirotors, with an egocentric point of view, while it is known that in mobile robotics overall awareness and pattern recognition are optimized by exocentric views. In this article we present an analysis of the performance achieved by human operators controlling a swarm of UAVs in formation, accomplishing different tasks and using different point of views. The control architecture is implemented in a ROS framework and interfaced with a 3D simulation environment. Experimental tests show a degradation of performance while using egocentric cameras with respect of an exocentric point of view, although cameras on board the robots allow to satisfactorily accomplish simple tasks.</abstract><custom3>2015 24th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

However, it is challenging to achieve real time tracking while keeping the MCSN a long life time with limited energy provision in a complicated environment. In this paper, we develop a collaborative perception and intelligent scheduling scheme, which jointly optimizes the system responding latency and tracking accuracy with the constraint of the available energy. A new hierarchical architecture is proposed to realize the coupled function of perception and computation. In particular, the multi-node collaborative perception scheme is applied to obtain the excellent sensing capacity, and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play as the edge nodes to provide the computing service for those resource-constrained sensor nodes. To reach the sustained target tracking, we propose an intelligent tracking policy by exploiting the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent collaboration scheme can improve the tracking accuracy by 45.5% compared with the random selection scheme. The system cost is also reduced approximately by 17.3% while guaranteeing the tracking accuracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

By implementing these algorithms in Matlab, we will use worked examples to show how each algorithm works. Firefly algorithm is one of the evolutionary optimization algorithms, and is inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies in nature. There are many noisy non-linear mathematical optimization problems that can be effectively solved by Metaheuristic Algorithms. Mathematical optimization or programming is the study of such planning and design problems using mathematical tools. Nowadays, computer simulations become an indispensable tool for solving such optimization problems with various efficient search algorithms. Nature-inspired algorithms are among the most powerful algorithms for optimization. Firefly algorithm is one of the new metaheuristic algorithms for optimization problems. The algorithm is inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies. A Firefly Algorithm (FA) is a recent nature inspired optimization algorithm, which simulates the flash pattern and characteristics of fireflies. It is a powerful swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the flash phenomenon of the fireflies. In this context, three types of meta-heuristics called Artificial bee Colony algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Firefly algorithms were devised to find optimal solutions of noisy non-linear continuous mathematical models. A series of computational experiments using each algorithm were conducted. The stimulation result of this experiment were analyzed and compared to the best solutions found so The Firefly algorithm in each noisy non linear optimization function seems to perform better and efficient.</abstract><custom3>2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

Within a swarm, UAVs communicate by means of a Flying Multi-hop Network (FMN), which due to its dynamics induces frequent changes of network topology and quality of the links. Recently, UAVs have also been used to provide Internet access and enhance the capacity of existing networks in Temporary Events. This brings up additional routing challenges not yet addressed, in order to provide always-on and high capacity paths able to meet the Quality of Service expected by the users.This paper presents RedeFINE, a centralized routing solution for FMNs that selects high-capacity paths between UAVs and avoids communications disruptions, by defining in advance the forwarding tables and the instants they shall be updated in the UAVs; this represents a major step forward with respect to traditional routing protocols. The performance evaluation of RedeFINE shows promising results, especially regarding Throughput and Packet Delivery Ratio, when compared with state of the art routing solutions.</abstract><custom3>2018 14th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

In this article, we formulate the beam pattern optimization problems, and propose an improved invasive weed optimization with random mutation and Lévy flight (IWORMLF) algorithm to synthesize the beam patterns of linear antenna arrays (LAAs) and circular antenna arrays (CAAs). IWORMLF introduces the random mutation operator and the Lévy flight mechanism to enhance the efficiency and to balance the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm for optimization problems. Several simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. First, IWORMLF is tested by a variety of benchmark functions, and the results indicate that it achieves the best performance in most of the functions compared to some other algorithms. Second, IWORMLF is utilized for the maximum sidelobe level (SLL) reduction and the joint maximum SLL and mainlobe beamwidth reductions. The results show that it achieves better performances in terms of the convergence rate, stability, and accuracy compared to some evolutionary algorithms for these optimization cases. Third, the efficiencies of the improved factors are verified. Finally, electromagnetism simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of IWORMLF for the beam pattern optimizations with considering mutual coupling.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

The method adopts the distributed architecture to improve the effectiveness of system optimization and the stability of system operation, which is suitable for the high-density network where the distribution of intersections is dense and traffic flow varies frequently. The method takes travel time delay and average queue ratio as the optimal objectives to build the traffic signal optimal model based on cell transmission model, and employs the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm and goal programming principles to optimize the traffic control parameters of the intersections. This method can improve the reaction speed for each intersection, timely optimize and assign space-time resource for the traffic flow in the network, and eliminate the gridlock caused by the too long queue that spreads to the upstream intersection.</abstract><custom3>2010 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R. t.

The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) has identified at least twenty enabling and enhancing goals to fulfill the existing lunar exploration Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG). Several of these goals will require multi-asset missions to the surface of the Moon involving human and machine interaction, as well as access to a ground station on Earth. Therefore, a communication enabling constellation deployed around the moon will serve as a crucial enabling technology for such missions. However, the limited orbital stability of lunar orbits constrains the use of traditional central body orbits for designing these constellations. The Earth-Moon Lagrange points, on the other hand, offer a viable location to deploy these constellations. The stationarity of the Lagrange points coupled with the fact that they have a large line of sight access area to the Moon's surface makes them a viable candidate for deploying constellations with a minimal number of spacecraft. However, the design of a Lagrange point constellation mission is not straight forward. This involves selecting the Lagrange points that offer the optimal coverage, optimal quasi-stationary trajectories around these Lagrange points, the optimal transfer to these trajectories, and the design of the constituent spacecraft. Clearly, this multi-disciplinary problem can benefit from a unifying mission design architecture that simultaneously handles the above-mentioned challenges. In our previous work, we developed the Integrated Design Engineering and Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software do design swarm missions to solar system small bodies. This work will focus on extending the capability of the IDEAS architecture to design optimal constellations deployed at the Earth-Moon Lagrange points. The constellation will be designed to act as a relay network to Earth with a minimum number of spacecraft. The performance of the constellation will be noted by studying the accessible regions on the surface of the moon. The approach taken by this work is as follows. We begin by modeling the coverage of spacecraft antenna by studying the accessible areas. The spacecraft will be assumed to be in halo orbits about the colinear Lagrange points. A selection scheme for the halo orbits is then discussed in order to coverage, synchronization, and stability requirements. Finally, the principles described are demonstrated by designing a Lagrange point constellation with three spacecraft that have access to at least 85 % of the Moon's surface and can communicate with at least 70 % of the surface at any given instant. The requirements and performance of this constellation are then evaluated assuming state-of-the-art hardware capabilities. The results indicate successful performance of the developed algorithms thus enabling the IDEAS architecture to generate holistic optimal designs which will greatly increase the returns of the future missions to the Moon.</abstract><custom3>2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

In order to shorten the length of the travel path and further reduce the energy consumption of the network transmission, the mobile sinks travel path was planned. Determining the visiting point of each overlapping area, and use the wolf pack algorithm (WPA) to plan a traveling path. Because the visiting point is a point within the overlapping area of communication ranges of sensors not one by one access to each node, it effectively reduces the length of the path. This method not only shortens the length of the traveling path for the mobile sink but reduces the computational effort required for traveling-path planning by the TSP algorithm as well.

The objective of the RAS project is to develop a distributed multi-layer autonomous UAS planning and control technology for gathering intelligence in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) environments populated by intelligent adaptive adversaries. These resilient autonomous systems are able to navigate through hostile environments while collecting intelligence and minimizing the loss of assets. Our approach incorporates artificial life concepts, with the high-level architecture divided into three biologically inspired meta-layers: cyber-physical, reactive, and deliberative. Each meta-layer is a combination of N layers, each representing simple behavior, and collectively having a dynamic level of influence over the behavior of the agent. Algorithms within each layer act on a combination of perceptions, memory, and intents. Perceptions represent a filtered view of reality, abstracted in the layer immediately below, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next highest layer. Intents represent a recommended action output from the layer above, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next lowest layer. Each cycle, perceptions and intents are cleared. Memory permeates each layer, and allows the layers to retain some knowledge from previous cycles. Fast-reactive control systems in low meta-layers ensure a stable environment supporting cognitive function on higher meta-layers. The key concepts of our approach are: A layered architecture of intelligence on a spectrum from reactive to deliberative; the use of artificial life algorithms providing robust, complex behavior from a set of simple rules; communication of information between agents via observation; the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to assist the team in selecting and adapting the best solutions for each layer. This distributed cooperative system of intelligent assets will provide adaptable, scalable performance to accomplish mission goals in challenging environments.</abstract><custom3>2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

With cutting edge patterns to move to new and fresh sources of electrical vitality framework it may possible to have major hydro control eras in the near future. It increments the difficulty to see the principles of LFC of hydro control regions. The hydro regions are essentially unsteady structures as it takes more time by hydro turbine to revert for continuous load alterations in control eras.

The quick deployment of WSN, comprised of ground sensors and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) flying above building height, enables a new communication network to be formed instantly. However, due to the obstruction of buildings and movement of sensor nodes, communications among the sensor nodes is intermittent resulting in frequent partitioning of the network. The epidemic routing protocol, with its simple and robust flooding nature has made communication in a partitioned network possible, exploiting the mobility of the network nodes and based on pair-wise communication. However, due to the broadcast nature of this protocol, problems such as redundancy rebroadcast, contention and collisions, collectively known as the broadcast storm problem, have been observed. We first recommend a more detailed radio propagation modelling approach for the urban environment for more realistic simulation studies. Further, we propose an adaptive probabilistic epidemic protocol for WSN in the urban environment that adapts to the network topology over time. Through simulation studies, we show that this protocol improves the performance of the WSN in terms of data packet delivery probability compared to the case without probabilistic transmission in epidemic protocol.</abstract><custom3>2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to construct a clustered-backbone to support both broadcast and unicast communications for UAV networks. In our algorithm, UAVs clustering and virtual backbone construction only need the information exchange among adjacent UAVs.

Effectively networking services across distributed systems (e.g., drone formations) allows nodes to contribute their collective resources toward achieving mission objectives. Automating unit coordination and node management, within a reusable middleware framework, aligns with goals envisioned in NASA's Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) and the National Research Council's Space Studies Board recommendations for CubeSat swarms and constellations for advanced aerospace missions. To provide reliable system management, software services should possess automaticity and fault-tolerance. Additionally, networking services for aerospace platforms should be robust, portable, and reusable for many mission life cycles.

When employing state-of-the-art deep learning-based traffic predictors in FL systems, the existing FL frameworks confront overlarge communication overhead when transmitting these models’ parameter updates since the modeling depth and breadth renders them incorporating an enormous number of parameters. In this article, we propose a practical FL scheme, namely, Clustering-based hierarchical and Two-step-optimized FL (CTFed), to tackle this issue. The proposed scheme follows a divide et impera strategy that clusters the clients into multiple groups based on the similarity between their local models’ parameters. We integrate the particle swarm optimization algorithm and devises a two-step approach for local model optimization. This scheme enables only one but representative local model update from each cluster to be uploaded to the central server, thus reduces the communication overhead of the model updates transmission in FL. CTFed is orthogonal to the gradient compression- or sparsification-based approaches so that they can orchestrate to optimize the communication overhead. Extensive case studies on three real-world data sets and three state-of-the-art models demonstrate the outstanding training efficiency, accurate prediction performance, and robustness to unstable network environments of the proposed scheme.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

These UAV-enabled networks can meet several complex mission requirements and are seen as a potential enabler for many of the emerging use-cases in future communication networks. Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and mobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which can cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks are envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their own challenges and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we analyze the key security and resilience issues resulting from the application of wireless mesh networks within UAV swarms. Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of applying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose existing vulnerabilities across the communication stack. Based on this analysis, we present a security-focused architecture for UAV mesh communications. Finally, from the identification of these vulnerabilities, we discuss research opportunities posed by the unique challenges of UAV swarm connectivity.</abstract><custom3>2021 17th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

Beyond the limits of single UAV system, multi-UAV systems which can perform complex missionoriented tasks better have been recently introduced. However, previous systems are less automated in the way that human intervention is still required to execute missions, and they were implemented for the only purpose of carrying out specific scenarios. In this paper, in order to automate the required procedures in the system and increase system flexibility, we propose a control integrated query processing system for coordination of multiple UAVs. We devise a high level query language to express a user command for a variety of UAVs' tasks by integrating the ways of controlling movements and actions of multiple UAVs and collecting data from them. We present the overall architecture of the query processing system and experimental results on testbed using real UAVs.</abstract><custom3>2017 14th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications &amp; Networking Conference (CCNC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

This could open the door to new exciting applications in earth observation, telecommunication or in-orbit servicing. Such missions are expected to have important benefits in terms of low system and deployment costs, distributed sensor capability or high reliability due to redundancy. In order to take advantage of a swarm configuration, a communication concept is required, which deals in a generic way with specific space environments and is able to cope with frequent topology changes. Up to now, space communication has only addressed static inter-satellite links (ISL), mainly based on proprietary protocols. In this paper, we propose to adopt well-known terrestrial communication standards. Such standards have been proven to be well conceived for a wide range of applications. WiFi is one prominent representative of such candidates which includes the ability of ad-hoc networking in order to provide decentralized and distributed wireless networks. Space specific requirements demand minor adaptions of the communication protocols. COTS components are also suitable for such protocols with minor changes. This paper studies these adaptions in depth, both in theory and by simulations and is therefore an important step towards its realization. To our knowledge, there is currently no suitable communication technology which has been adapted for swarm missions with small satellites.</abstract><custom3>2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

The Airborne Embedded auTonomOUs Robust Network of Objects and Sensors (AETOURNOS) project is designed as a federative, fueling platform and global evaluation tool. It has spawned another collaborative project bridging the gap between Computer Science and Automation: 6PO (Cyber-Physical Systems and Cooperative Control of a Fleet of UAVs). We want to investigate new flocking strategies, mobility-aware communication protocols (and reciprocally: movements influenced by network QoS), and to ease the cooperation between experts, we need co-simulation solutions, and “universal” control interfaces. This article presents our first contribution to this grand scheme: a stand-alone simulation of an autonomous flocking strategy taking into account both the dynamics of the UAVs and their communications, which has allowed us to examine the relation between network unreliability and control computation. To better study the influence of the communication network, we present an architecture coupling a dedicated network simulator with the UAVs simulator, as well as with a real drone piloting interface. The lessons learned help us build a research and action plan for the years to come.</abstract><custom3>2014 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

While SDN is mainly applied in wired networks, we attempt to utilize it in a futuristic drone-based network architecture to capitalize on the programmability and flexibility offered by SDN. Such drone network comprises a multi-hop network of drones as the nodes of the network which also act as programmable network nodes and forwarding elements. In such a dynamic and mobile network, maintaining SDN controller connectivity becomes a challenge, especially when the drone network requires operating independently from a ground infrastructure for some deployment scenarios. In this work, we attempt to address this challenge by implementing a dynamic scheme for controller placement that deploys a minimum number of drones that operate as SDN controllers and adjust their locations dynamically as the controlled nodes adjust their locations to meet changing mission requirements.</abstract><custom3>2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

Real-time updates including positions of neighboring nodes is performed when, for example, autonomous vehicles execute a cooperative maneuver, industrial robots collaborate with each other on a task, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) execute a mission in a swarm. For the design of networked automatic control strategies in these scenarios, it is essential to understand the performance of such Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications from the information freshness perspective. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework which allows characterizing the Age of Information (AoI) in networks governed by the Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol. Differently from existing work, we take into account the fact that update packets sent by mobile nodes are not necessarily periodic, since packet triggering is often coupled with agents’ mobility. Our approach is based on the assumption that diverse mobility-triggered message generation patterns can be modeled by a wide class of update traffic arrival processes. We apply Discrete Markovian Arrival Process (DMAP), which is a versatile arrival model able to fit arrival patterns that are modulated by a finite state machine, including bursty traffic. We develop an accurate and efficient analytical model of nodes exchanging one-hop broadcast update messages with bursty arrivals to evaluate the moments as well as entire probability distribution of several performance metrics, including AoI. An asymptotic analysis for large networks suggests a simple way to control the update message rate to minimize the AoI. We show that the optimal update rate that minimizes the mean AoI coincides with the optimum of the wireless channel utilization. Numerical examples point out that the asymptotic theory provides accurate predictions also for small values of the number of nodes.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

This is especially necessary and important when carrying out tasks on distributed machines in a formation. Examples for application are parallel harvesting process in agricultural business or the cooperative search for survivors after a snow slide or e.g. an earthquake in urban scenarios. Moreover, it is very important to ensure relative position information in case of partial failure or a poor reception of the GNSS receiver, for example to avoid the collision between the machines. Options to handle this problem are the coupling of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements with measurements of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). A further improvement or stabilization can be done by vision based systems, like 2D- or 3D-camera system using methods of optical flow for motion estimation. Another possibility for improvement for determining the swarm geometry, which will be described in this paper, is the so called swarm positioning method. This method is based on the exchange of the measured GNSS raw data, i.e. range measurements, between each participant in the swarm using a mobile ad-hoc network. Additionally, GNSS raw measurements and inertial measurements are coupled using multiple filters in order to detect degraded GNSS measurements and exclude these from further data processing. The challenge of the mobile ad-hoc network is the time variant network structure and the small available transmission rate in combination with a high demand for quick data exchange. The requirement to respond very flexibly to changes in topology and to compensate the loss of individual network participants as well as to spontaneously integrate further participants forbids the use of a fixed coordinator. Therefore different routing algorithms have to be combined and developed to ensure an information exchange in various scenarios.</abstract><custom3>Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Motor imagery (MI), in which motor actions are mentally rehearsed without engaging in actual physical execution, has been widely used as a major BCI approach. One robust algorithm that can successfully cope with the individual differences in MI-related rhythmic patterns is to create diverse ensemble classifiers using the subband common spatial pattern (SBCSP) method. To aggregate outputs of ensemble members, this study uses fuzzy integral with particle swarm optimization (PSO), which can regulate subject-specific parameters for the assignment of optimal confidence levels for classifiers. The proposed system combining SBCSP, fuzzy integral, and PSO exhibits robust performance for offline single-trial classification of MI and real-time control of a robotic arm using MI. This paper represents the first attempt to utilize fuzzy fusion technique to attack the individual differences problem of MI applications in real-world noisy environments. The results of this study demonstrate the practical feasibility of implementing the proposed method for real-world applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

As relay nodes can provide a solution, a scenario for a plan of relay nodes deployment at the cell edge is proposed, taking into account the interference due to the relay nodes. Since optimization algorithms are effective in terms of planning, an advanced hybrid particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA) is applied to the proposed scenario to detect the optimum solution. The optimum solution represents the optimum plan that attains the best coverage with the minimum cost. We submit cost analysis depends on three trails of construction cost, power and channel cost efficiency. To highlight that the optimal plan has been revealed, another recently developed optimization algorithm, a simplified adaptive bat algorithm based on frequency (FSABA) and a classic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are also applied to the suggested scenario. The obtained results are compared with the related findings of the PSOGSA. From the simulations, it is found that the PSOGSA achieves better performance than the other two algorithms with fruitful and promising results, and the optimal plan featuring great coverage at the cell edge and cost-saving is attained.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Managing this type of network is a challenging task. Clustering is a technique to efficiently manage resources in this type of network. In a cluster, all inter/intra cluster communication is managed by a cluster head (CH). Load on each CH, the lifetime of the cluster and the total number of clusters in a network are some parameters to measure the efficiency of the network. In this paper, a novel technique based on moth flame clustering algorithm for IoV (MFCA-IoV) is proposed. Moth flame optimizer is a nature-inspired algorithm. MFCA-IoV generates optimized clusters for robust transmission and is evaluated experimentally with renowned techniques. These techniques are Grey-Wolf-optimization-based method used for the clustering called as GWOCNETs, multi-objective particle-swarm-optimization (MOPSO), clustering algorithm based on Ant colony optimization for vehicular ad-hoc networks termed as CACONET and comprehensive learning particle-swarm-optimization (CLPSO). To assess the comparative efficiency of these algorithms, numerous experiments are performed. The parameters like network grid-size, number of nodes, speed, direction, and transmission-range of the nodes are considered for optimized clustering. The results indicate, MFCA-IoV is showing 73% nodes, which are not selected as a cluster head while existing techniques are providing 57%, 50%, 51%, and 58% for GWOCNETs, CLPSO, MOPSO, and CACONET, respectively. Hence, lesser the nodes are selected as CH, the more optimal result will be considered.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

A TMFN consists of a mobile and physically reconfigurable network of Flying Mesh Access Points (FMAPs) and Gateways, which is able to dynamically reconfigure its topology according to the users' traffic demands - characterized by the users' positions and offered traffic. To implement this concept, a novel traffic-aware Network Planning (NetPlan) algorithm is proposed, which dynamically determines the FMAPs' coordinates and Wi-Fi cell ranges according to the users' traffic demands, in order to improve the TMFN's aggregate throughput, without compromising the overall coverage. Simulation results obtained in scenarios typically observed in TCEs demonstrate improved Quality of Service metrics, specifically the mean throughput, thus validating the proposed NetPlan algorithm.</abstract><custom3>2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Most of fully autonomous UAVs navigation system is dependent on GNSS for localization. But the security threats that emanates from GPS system; spoofing and jamming makes the reliance on GNSS problematic. In this work, we proposed a fully autonomous UAV navigation system without GNSS and wireless communication. The application area of interest in this work is military battlefield. The proposed navigation method combines information gathered by Intelligence Preparation for Battlefield (IPB) and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance(ISR) group and onboard sensors.

Nevertheless, it has hardly been considered until now. The communication systems for cubesats have to deal with a few peculiar demands regarding consumed power, geometry and throughput. Depending on the type of application, required data rates can go up to tens of megabits per second, while power consumption and physical size are limited by the platform. The proposed communication scheme will combine power-efficient modulation and channel coding with multiple access and spread spectrum techniques, enabling the deployment of multiple satellites. Apart from this, the antenna system has to be designed such that links can be established and maintained independent of the satellites' orientation. An electrically steerable radiation pattern is achieved by placing antennas on each face of the cube. Conformal beamforming provides the system with 5 dBi gain for any desired direction of transmission, eliminating the need for attitude control. Furthermore, using planar antennas reduces the complexity of the mechanical part as they require no deployment.</abstract><custom3>2013 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

With 5G New Radio (5G NR), UAS swarm networking can yield high capacities of mobile communication to provide more stable, effective services for UAS swarm. However, the conventional architectures of UAS swarm networking are centralized and hierarchical, thus restricting the high volume communication due to heterogeneous swarm communication, and the deployment of UAS swarms on a large scale. In this paper, inspired by the behavior of cell communication, we propose a cell wall oriented bi-throughput optimization algorithm for UAS swarm networking. To be specific, We leverage edge-coloring to optimize the routing schedule to obtain the maximum throughput for each UAS swarm. The evaluation shows that the throughput from both directions can be enhanced to achieve an improvement of up to 90% when the time slot is less than 0. 01s. The 5G-enabled optimal bi-throughput solution shows great potential to provide UAS swarm networking more compatible capacities for the challenging mission in real-time.</abstract><custom3>2020 International Conference on Space-Air-Ground Computing (SAGC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V.

The overall cost (including price, weight, energy, etc.) of the payload required by some missions is sometimes too important to enable the robots of the swarm to embed all the required capabilities (i.e., sensors and actuators). This is the reason why it is more suitable to spread all the capabilities among the robots of the swarm. In this case, it is necessary to implement a collaborative system inside the swarm in order to share the capabilities among them. This collaborative system should provide task allocation as well as management of conflicts and failures which can occur at any moment. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative system for heterogeneous swarms of autonomous mobile robots called AMiRALE (Asynchronous Missions Relay for Autonomous and Lively Entities). Our system if fully distributed and relies only on asynchronous communications. We provide a formal description of our proposal based on a graph relabeling system. We also present experimental results obtained through both simulation and emulation.

We consider a network where a fleet of UAVs at a fixed altitude flies on planned trajectories and IoT devices on the ground are scheduled to transmit their data to the UAVs when the latter are nearby. In such a system, the UAVs' motion triggers the uplink transmissions of the IoT devices. As a result, network performance is determined by the geometric and dynamic characteristics of the system. We propose a joint stationary model for UAVs and IoT devices and then evaluate the interference, the coverage probability, and the data rate of the typical UAV. To assess the harvesting capability of the proposed architecture, we derive a formula for the amount of data uploaded from each IoT device to a UAV. We also establish a linear relationship between the UAV coverage and the harvesting capability of the network, which provides insights into the design of the proposed harvesting scheme. In addition, we use our analytical results to numerically show that there exists a trade-off between the uploaded data and the size of the IoT scheduling window. Specifically, for a given UAV and IoT geometry, there exists an optimal scheduling window that maximizes the harvesting capability of the proposed network.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

In this framework, the use of Ka-band for communication is explored. We present the design of a stacked patch antenna working across the down- and uplink Ka-bands. Materials and geometry of the radiator have been selected by accounting for the trade-off between electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical requirements. The design of the antenna is performed with a particle swarm optimization algorithm developed to control the bandwidth and matching. A bandwidth of 5.53@33.185 GHz has been obtained, with a gain around 8 dB. Furthermore, a multiphysics thermal analysis is performed to verify the operational stability of the optimized array, mounted on a 1 U satellite, in a case-study mission. The temperature patterns in the array are evaluated during the orbital period, and the influence of the operative temperature on the antenna responses and gain was considered. We found that the thermal loads can affect the antenna matching. However, thanks to the optimized design, the proposed stacked antenna can operate from −100 $^{\circ }$C to 100 $^{\circ }$C, with an almost constant gain. Finally, following a damage-tolerant approach, the level of mechanical deformation, which could be induced on the communication system, was studied. The stress analysis reveals that the stacked geometry can be used in a space mission. From the investigation of the strain and displacement field, we found a negligible impact on the antenna performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

In a search and rescue mission (SAR) scenario, the network solution based on Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) can meet the special requirements of this mission. However, due to the high cost of establishing a real experimental environment, network simulation is considered to be the most practical research method in most cases. For FANETs, modeling and simulation based on the mobility of a UAV in a specific scene have an important impact on the performance of routing protocols. Therefore, to develop an excellent FANETs routing protocol for SAR task scenarios, it is necessary to design a three-dimensional (3D) mobility model suitable for this scenario. This paper first analyzes the design requirements of FANETs 3D mobility model under the SAR task scene. According to these requirements, we proposed a 3DSRCM mobility model based on semi-random Circular Movement (SRCM). Based on the helix and pheromone, we design the track with its selection and switching mechanism for the model. Subsequently, we tested the relevant performance of the model according to the design requirements, and the test results proved that the model could truly simulate the movement behavior of UAV in the SAR scene, with excellent coverage and smooth three-dimensional trajectory, as well as relatively good spatial node distribution and network connectivity.</abstract><custom3>2021 7th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

One of these mechanisms consists to integrate simultaneously many criteria of quality of service (QoS) in routing decision. Efficient routing of information packets in dynamically changing communication network requires that as the load levels, traffic patterns and topology of the network change, the routing policy also adapts. We propose in this paper an approach used an adaptive algorithm for packet routing using reinforcement learning called AV-BW Delay Q- Routing. This approach is based on earlier developed K-Optimal path Q-Routing Algorithm (KOQRA) which optimizes simultaneously two additive QoS criteria: cumulative cost path and end-to-end delay. The approach developed here adds a third criterion to KOQRA regarding residual bandwidth. This proposed technique uses an inductive approach based on trial/error paradigm combined with swarm adaptive approaches. The whole algorithm uses a model combining both a stochastic planned pre-navigation for the exploration phase and a deterministic approach for the backward phase. Numerical results obtained with OPNET simulator for different levels of traffic's load show that AV-BW Delay Q-Routing improves clearly performances of our earlier KOQRA.</abstract><custom3>2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.

The end-users are always demanding all kinds of network services including the time-critical and mission-critical ones. The Quality of Network Services (QoNS) of the future 5G and 6G networks are aiming to address all possible types of flexible user demands optimally. Telecom. Service Providers (TSPs) are rigorously looking for suitable network architectures that can assist them to realize such user-friendly systems. vSDN or virtualized Software Defined Network Architecture is the key technology enabler that makes such functionalities possible. In the recent paradigm shift where everything is being based on IoT, service availability and system stability are two major concerns. For keeping the quality index of the network services high, it is essential to orchestrate and deploy the network infrastructures that will provide additional and upgraded network services. Keeping these fundamental issues in mind, in this work, we have proposed a novel multi-instance deployment strategy for Controllers and Hypervisors over an actual network topology. While defining the work, our prime concern targets improving service availability within the ULL (Ultra-Low Latency) environment. Thus, we have developed a Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem for optimally placing the hypervisors and controllers over the network topology to minimize the H-plane service agreements along with propagation latency of network function demands. After analyzing the results, it can be claimed that our approach has a significant impact in improving the QoS of network parameters. The proposed model can be applied in similar time-critical relocation problems associated with UAV-assisted networks depending upon various application domains.</abstract><custom3>IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.

As a critical component of the aviation swarm, the airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communications capability, enabling information sharing between both manned and unmanned military aircrafts as well as surface and ground platforms. The deficiencies of legacy ATNs, particularly their inability to meet the communications demands of the aviation swarm, motivated us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm to the ATN and to design an SDN-enabled ATN (SD-ATN) for the aviation swarm. For the SDN paradigm, the communications efficiency between the control plane and the data plane directly impacts the normal operations of the network, raising a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN, which is that how to ensure the QoS requirements of the non-elastic information transmitted between the control plane and the data plane (non-elastic C/D information) is met. To address this issue, a transmission framework is first proposed to make it practical to provide dedicated QoS guarantee for the non-elastic C/D information. Then, a communication protocol is designed based on the proposed framework, aiming at transmitting the non-elastic C/D information in a reliable and real-time manner. The simulation results show that, in the aviation environment, our scheme does improve the transmission efficiency of the non-elastic C/D information, which performs better than legacy solutions.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

For the automated control of such a microrobotic system with small size and large population, conventional methods using precise robot models and robot-robot communications lose effectiveness due to the complex locomotion of micro/nano agents in a swarm and difficult implementation of onboard actuators and sensors for individual motion control and motion feedback. This article proposes a statistics-based approach and reports the fully automated control of a swarm of paramagnetic nanoparticles including the swarm pattern formation, identification, tracking, motion control, and real-time distribution monitoring/control. By establishing the swarm statistics, collective behaviors of a nanoparticle swarm can be quantitatively analyzed by computers. Algorithms are designed based on the statistics to automatically generate and identify the vortex-like paramagnetic nanoparticle swarm (VPNS), which present robustness to the dose and initial distribution of the nanoparticle swarm. In order to robustly track a VPNS, a statistics-based tracking method is proposed, in which 500 boundary points of the VPNS are extracted and the VPNS distribution is optimally recognized. And, with the proposed gathering improvement control, experiments show that over 70% nanoparticles can be gathered in the VPNS. Furthermore, an automated motion control scheme for the VPNS is proposed which shows high-accuracy trajectory tracking performance (tracking error: &lt;; 5% body length). Besides, real-time monitoring of the distribution region/density and control of the distribution area for a nanoparticle swarm are also realized by using the statistics. Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method in automated control of paramagnetic nanoparticle swarms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The configuration of these tasks related to single or multi-robot algorithms depends on the individual requirements of the scenario (i.e. number of entities, communication bandwidth, failure assumptions). Therefore, the developer may decide to run a path planning algorithm individually for each robot to avoid an additional exchange of information. For a scenario with a large communication bandwidth, a planner in the global context would be more suitable in order to receive an optimal result. In this paper we present an architecture that implements this decision online. Our context-aware task controller evaluates the communication situation and triggers a context switch (global, local, individual) of the task execution. By shifting the decision from design-time to run-time, we close the gap between supervision and swarm approaches and provide an optimized behavior.</abstract><custom3>2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Governments and industry alike have been heavily investing in the development of UAVs. As such it is important to understand the characteristics of networks with UAVs to enable the incorporation of multiple, coordinated aerial vehicles into the air traffic in a reliable and safe manner. To this end, this survey reports the characteristics and requirements of UAV networks for envisioned civil applications over the period 2000-2015 from a communications and networking viewpoint. We survey and quantify quality-of-service requirements, network-relevant mission parameters, data requirements, and the minimum data to be transmitted over the network. Furthermore, we elaborate on general networking related requirements such as connectivity, adaptability, safety, privacy, security, and scalability. We also report experimental results from many projects and investigate the suitability of existing communication technologies for supporting reliable aerial networking.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D. -Y.

In such scenarios, data dissemination of events towards mobile sinks should be performed reliably. In this paper we present Honeycomb Architecture which enables data dissemination considering dynamic conditions of multiple sinks and sources. Honeycomb Architecture exploits a virtual infrastructure called ‘highways’, which is an area where all event data are cached. The ‘highways’ act as rendezvous regions of the events and queries. Once a query is issued, it is sent to one of the ‘highways’ and searches relevant data stored in the ‘highway’. When the data is found, it is sent to the sink which has issued the query. Our data dissemination protocol is fault-tolerant, i.e., it can bypass holes in the network. We evaluate and compare the data delivery ratio and latency of our data dissemination protocol with previous approaches. We also analyze the hotspot regions in the network with different protocols. Simulation results show that our work significantly reduces overall energy consumption while maintaining comparably high data delivery ratio.</abstract><custom3>2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>I.

With the help of wireless energy transfer technology, electrical energy can be transfer from Wireless Charging Equipment (WCE) to the sensor nodes, providing a new paradigm to prolong the network lifetime. Existing research usually takes the periodical and deterministic charging approach, but ignore the limited energy of the WCE and the influences of non-deterministic factors such as topological changes and node failures, making them unsuitable for real networks. In this study, we aim to minimize the number of dead sensor nodes while maximizing energy utilization of WCE under the limited energy of the WCE. Furthermore, the Swarm Reinforcement Learning (SRL) method is firstly introduced to achieve the autonomous planning ability of WCE. Moreover, to solve the problem of insufficient search in existing SRL algorithm, we improve the SRL by firefly algorithm. And a novel charging algorithm, named Swarm Reinforcement Learning based on Firefly Algorithm (SRL-FA), is proposed for the on-demand charging architecture. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, SRL-FA is compared with the existing swarm reinforcement learning algorithms and classic on-demand charging algorithms in two network scenarios. The Extensive simulation shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve promising performance in energy utilization of WCE, charging success rate and other performance metrics.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

In this paper, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted IoT architecture is introduced, in which UAV is utilized to achieve low-latency and seamless-coverage acquisition of the sensing data. Furthermore, based on the recent advances on deep reinforcement learning algorithms, considering both data delay requirements and network energy consumption, a real-time flight path planning scheme of the UAV in the dynamic IoT sensor networks has been proposed based on dueling deep Q-network (DQN).

Compared with conventional centralized SDVNs, hybrid SDVNs combine the centralized control of SDVNs and self-organized distributed routing of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) to mitigate the burden on the central controller caused by the frequent uplink and downlink transmissions. Although a wide variety of routing protocols have been developed, existing protocols are designed for specific scenarios without considering flexibility and adaptivity in dynamic vehicular networks. To address this problem, we propose an efficient online sequential learning-based adaptive routing scheme, namely, Penicillium reproduction-based Online Learning Adaptive Routing scheme (POLAR) for hybrid SDVNs. By utilizing the computational power of edge servers, this scheme can dynamically select a routing strategy for a specific traffic scenario by learning the pattern from network traffic. Firstly, this paper applies Geohash to divide the large geographical area into multiple grids, which facilitates the collection and processing of real-time traffic data for regional management in controller. Secondly, a new Penicillium Reproduction Algorithm (PRA) with outstanding optimization capabilities is designed to improve the learning effectiveness of Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM). Finally, POLAR is deployed in control plane to generate decision-making model (i.e., routing policy). Based on the real-time featured data, this scheme can choose the optimal routing strategy for a specific area. Extensive simulation results show that POLAR is superior to a single traditional routing protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and latency.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S. -C.

In light of the need of network characterizations, we analyze the connected M2M network in the machine swarm of geometric random graph topology, including degree distribution, network diameter, and average distance (i.e., hops). Without the need of end-to-end information to escape catastrophic complexity, information dissemination appears an effective way in machine swarm. To fully understand practical data transportation, G/G/1 queuing network model is exploited to obtain average end-to-end delay and maximum achievable system throughput. Furthermore, as real applications may require dependable networking performance across the swarm, quality of service (QoS) along with large network diameter creates a new intellectual challenge. We extend the concept of small-world network to form shortcuts among data aggregators as infrastructure-swarm two-tier heterogeneous network architecture, then leverage the statistical concept of network control instead of precise network optimization, to innovatively achieve QoS guarantees.

There is significant interest in asteroids as evidenced by multiple completed and ongoing asteroid missions. However, these missions heavily rely on human oversight and Earth-based resources such as the NASA Deep Space Network. Such an approach is not sustainable in the long term due to cost and oversubscribed Earth-based resources. Furthermore, these missions typically utilize a single spacecraft that is slow to adapt to its environment due to light time delay and gaps in communication with the Earth. In contrast, ANS comprises multiple small spacecraft that operate autonomously after a brief ground-in-the-loop initialization. The spacecraft are equipped with low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) avionics including star trackers, short-range cameras, radio-frequency intersatellite links, and chip scale atomic clocks. The algorithmic framework developed in this paper utilizes the intersatellite links and images of the asteroid to simultaneously estimate the spacecraft states as well as the asteroid gravity field, shape, and rotational motion. This class of estimation problem is defined in this paper as simultaneous navigation and characterization (SNAC), which is a superset of simultaneous localization and mapping. The ANS SNAC framework consists of three novel modules: 1) multi-agent optical landmark tracking and 3D point reconstruction using stereovision, 2) state estimation through a computationally efficient and robust unscented Kalman filter, and 3) reconstruction of a global spherical harmonic shape model by leveraging a priori knowledge of the shape properties of small celestial bodies. This new framework is validated through the numerical simulation of three spacecraft orbiting the asteroid 433 Eros. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides autonomous and accurate SNAC in a safe manner without any a priori shape model and using only low SWaP-C avionics.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The ISOC will allow superfast cross-links and will be a technology enabler for swarms and formation flying spacecraft. The ISOC under development features a truncated dodecahedron geometry that can hold an array of fast photodiode detectors and gimbal-less MEMS scanning mirrors. The main goals of the ISOC development include: 1) full sky coverage, 2) Gbps data rates and 3) the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous links. We have developed two omnidirectional communicator prototypes capable of full-duplex operation. We are using advanced single-mode laser diodes operating at 850 nm capable of producing hundreds of milliwatts of laser radiation. We are also employing MEMS-based beam steering mirrors, and fast PIN photodiodes to achieve long-range communications. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve full duplex operation at 1 Gbps data rates over 200 km and slightly lower data rates at longer distances. In this paper we describe the overall ISOC architecture and present the design tradeoffs for gigabit data-rate operation. We also present preliminary NRZ On-Off Keying communications simulation results obtained using our optical link budget model. The ISOC is ideally suited for crosslink communications among small spacecraft, especially for those forming a swarm and/or a constellation. Small spacecraft furnished with ISOC communications systems, should be able to communicate at gigabit per second rates over long distances. This data rate enhancement can allow real-time, global science measurements and/or ultra-high fidelity observations from tens or hundreds of Earth-orbiting satellites, or permit high-bandwidth, direct-to-earth communications for planetary missions.</abstract><custom3>2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.

Currently, VANETs are facing node management, security, and routing problems in V2V communication. Intelligent transportation systems have raised the research opportunity in routing, security, and mobility management in VANETs. One of the major challenges in VANETs is the optimization of routing for desired traffic scenarios. Traditional protocols such as Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), and Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV) are perfect for generic mobile nodes but do not fit for VANET due to the high and dynamic nature of vehicle movement. Similarly, swarm intelligence routing algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) routing techniques are partially successful for addressing optimized routing for sparse, dense, and realistic traffic network scenarios in VANET. Also, the majority of metaheuristics techniques suffer from premature convergence, being stuck in local optima, and poor convergence speed problems. Therefore, a Hybrid Genetic Firefly Algorithm-based Routing Protocol (HGFA) is proposed for faster communication in VANET. Features of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) are integrated with the Firefly algorithm and applied in VANET routing for both sparse and dense network scenarios. Extensive comparative analysis reveals that the proposed HGFA algorithm outperforms Firefly and PSO techniques with 0.77% and 0.55% of significance in dense network scenarios and 0.74% and 0.42% in sparse network scenarios, respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

The use of frequency beam-scan antennas reduces the complexity of the small satellite front-end by avoiding the need to use phase shifters, especially when a reliable inter-satellite link (ISL) is required to keep up the communication and the formation accurately in a CubeSat swarm mission. This paper reports the design and a manufacturing process focused on in-space manufacturing (ISM) of a fully 3D-printed leaky-wave antenna, using ULTEM 9085 for aerospace applications. The antenna shows frequency beam steering capabilities from 4.4 GHz to 7.4 GHz, and a gain reconfigurable by angular rotation of the ground planes. The resulting antenna shows a measured peak gain of 10.07 dBi at 6.5 GHz, with a gain reconfigurability, as function of the elevation angle of the ground planes, in the range of 0 to 40°, providing an additional gain from 0 to 2 dBi, respectively.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

A multi-targets tracking algorithm based on task allocation consensus is proposed for UAVs to track multiple moving targets under the distributed control architecture in the limited communication range. This algorithm creates a distributed dynamic task allocation model using intermittent asynchronous communication principle to realize the sharing of observation information gathered by each UAV with fewer communications. In addition, this algorithm also makes it possible that multi-UAVs can plan tracking paths for multiple moving targets. We implement the algorithm on the formation with three UAVs to track three moving targets through simulation. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

However, the fundamental and key component of the IoE depends on the computational intelligence (CI), which may be utilized in the sixth generation mobile communication system (6G). The motivation of this article presents the 6G enabled network in box (NIB) architecture as a powerful integrated solution that can support comprehensive network management and operations. The 6G enabled NIB can be used as an alternative method to meet the needs of next-generation mobile networks by dynamically reconfiguring the deployment of network functions, providing a high degree of flexibility for connection services in various situations. Especially the CI technology such as evolutionary computing, neural computing and fuzzy systems utilized as a part of NIB have inherent capabilities to handle various uncertainties, which have unique advantages in processing the variability and diversity of large amounts of data. Finally, CI technology for NIB, which is widely used is also introduced such as distributed computing, fog computing, and mobile edge computing in order to achieve different levels of sustainable computing infrastructure. This article discusses the key technologies, advantages, industrial scenario applications of CI technology as NIB, typical use cases and development trends based on IoE, which provides directional guidance for the development of CI technology as NIB for 6G.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Although a great deal of emphasis has been placed on the drone-assisted networks, existing work focuses on routing protocols without fully exploiting the drones superiority and flexibility. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a collaborative communication scheme for multiple drones to assist the urban vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). In this scheme, drones are distributed regarding the predicted terrestrial traffic condition in order to efficiently alleviate the inevitable problems of conventional VANETs, such as building obstacle, isolated vehicles, and uneven traffic loading. To effectively coordinate multiple drones, this issue is modeled as a multimodal optimization problem to improve the global performance on a certain space. To this end, a succinct swarm-based optimization algorithm, namely Multimodal Nomad Algorithm (MNA) is presented. This algorithm is inspired by the migratory behavior of the nomadic tribes on Mongolia grassland. Based on the floating car data of Chengdu China, extensive experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the MNA-optimized drone-assisted VANET. The results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of hop number, packet delivery ratio, and throughput.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

However, the limitation of AUVs’ battery cannot support persistent services, which restricts AUVs’ operating range and mission duration. In this paper, a mobile underwater charging solution is developed that can continuously recharge a swarm of AUVs by using a wireless mobile charger. Magnetic induction-based communication and wireless energy transfer are employed. This paper first shows that by using tri-axis coils, reliable wireless communication and wireless energy transfer without coil orientation losses can be obtained. After that, wireless communication, motion control, and wireless energy transfer are jointly designed for a swarm of mission-driven AUVs. In particular, optimal continuous motion controllers are developed for AUVs to avoid intra-swarm collisions and networking protocols are designed to optimally allocate resources for wireless communication and wireless energy transfer. The proposed approach can guide AUVs to their destinations, while maintaining wireless network integrity and maximizing wireless energy transfer efficiency, upon which the constraints on AUVs’ batteries can be eliminated and cheaper and smaller AUVs can be employed for various underwater applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

As objectives of these missions become more ambitious, there are still problems in increasing the number of communication windows, supporting multiple signals, and increasing data rates over reliable intersatellite and ground links to Earth. Also, there is a shortage of available frequencies in the 2 m and 70 cm bands due to rapid increase in the number of CubeSats orbiting the Earth - leading to further regulatory issues. Existing communication systems and radio signal processing Intellectual Property (IP) cores cannot fully address these challenges. One of the possible strategies to solve these issues is by equipping satellites with a Software Defined Radio (SDR). SDR is a key area to realise various software implementations which enable an adaptive and reconfigurable communication system without changing any hardware device or feature. This paper proposes a new SDR architecture which utilises a combination of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and field programmable Radio Frequency (RF) transceiver to solve back-end and front- end challenges and thereby enabling reception of multiple signals or satellites using single user equipment.</abstract><custom3>2014 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The heterogeneous collaboration between UAS swarm enhances the complexity and the efficiency of mission complement that requires robustness, flexibility, and sustainability of throughput in UAS swarm networking. The conventional approaches mainly are based on the hierarchical architectures that are limited to satisfy the challenges of UAS swarm with high dynamics on a large scale. In this paper, we propose an optimal cell wall paradigm to enhance the throughput in heterogeneous UAS swarm networking. With the weight adjustment of each link, we map the optimization into a polyhedron scheduling problem and formula the problem into Max-min Throughput Fair Scheduling (MTFS). Further, we propose a max-min throughput algorithm to optimize the minimum throughput of cell wall paradigm. With the optimal max-min throughput, we optimize the schedule with edge-coloring to achieve global MTFS solving. The normalized MTFS shows our algorithm can achieve over 40% improvement of MTFS globally. In terms of MTFS solving, our algorithms have promising potential to improve the throughput and mitigate the incidents for multiple beams enabling of UAS in cell wall communication.

In order to effectively remove irrelevant or redundant features, the use of feature selection methods can reduce the number of features, improve the accuracy of the model, and reduce the running time. In recent years, Wrapper-based feature selection algorithms have received widespread attention because they can obtain better accuracy. This paper uses a wrapper feature selection algorithm FS_SSA based on Salp swarm. In the FS_SSA algorithm, the position of the follower salps is updated by the relative position of the Salp. The followers gradually moves to the leading Salp. The gradual movement of the follower salps can make the Salp Swarm Algorithm not easy to fall into a local optimal state. The two behaviors of exploration and development in subset searches are balanced, and the search process of feature subsets is prevented from falling into the local optimum. Experimental results based on public medical data sets show that the FS_SSA has better classification performance than other methods.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE International Conference on Information Communication and Software Engineering (ICICSE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

In order to address this problem, we propose Mobile Intelligent Fog Computing: An Energy-efficient Cross-layer-sensing Clustering Method (ECCM). The first, according to the cross-layer projection principle, the proposed algorithm employs the sensing-event-driven mechanism to project the fog nodes onto the sensing layer, and constructs a powerful virtual control node. Then the control procedure of the cluster-based routing protocol in sensor networks is uploaded to the fog layer and the fog computation is employed to achieve the distributed clustering of the event-field nodes. The second, the optimized data aggregation routing is constructed, which centers the projectile fog nodes. The data in the bottom-layer routing of the sensor network is thus replaced, and the network load is balanced and reduced. The third, in the optimization of the routing protocol, we introduce the Particles Swarm Optimization, (PSO) algorithm and elect a group of optimal nodes as the cluster heads, without the cost of any competition overhead, the energy overhead of the network can be effectively reduced and balanced, which curbs the rapid exhaustion of the node energy and prolongs the network lifetime. Finally, it is shown by the simulation results that the construction and the maintenance of the routing structure are small, which could optimize the data aggregation efficiency and improve the network performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

In this paper, a sidelobe suppression approach (JSSA) to suppress the maximum SLL by jointly optimizing the locations and amplitude weights of the nodes is proposed. JSSA organizes the node positions according to the concentric circular antenna array for location optimization. Then, a novel algorithm called variation particle chicken swarm optimization (VPCSO) is proposed to further optimize the amplitude weights of the selected CB nodes. The proposed VPCSO introduces the variation mechanism and location learning mechanism to enhance the performance of the conventional chicken swarm optimization algorithm. Simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed location optimization approach is effective, and the maximum SLLs of beam patterns obtained by VPCSO are lower than that of other algorithms. Moreover, the energy consumption can be saved by VPCSO. In addition, electromagnetic (EM) simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed JSSA in EM environments.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used as a viable remote sensing solution for planetary exploration, as desiccation cracks are difficult to identify with the naked eye and are normally located in complex and unreachable environments. However, most UAVs have a strong reliance on human operators through their communication systems, as UAVs have limited onboard decision-making capabilities for autonomous navigation in such environments. UAV navigation in real-world scenarios is also challenging as data captured from their sensors is imperfect, and outputs from computer vision systems are, sometimes, inaccurate. These sensory and onboard vision limitations cause partial observability of the state of surveyed environments, inducing uncertainty in optimal path planning. This paper proposes a UAV system for autonomous onboard navigation, identification, and mapping of desiccation cracks for planetary exploration. The navigation problem is mathematically formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where a motion strategy can be obtained by solving the POMDP in real time using the augmented belief tree (ABT) solver. The framework discussed in this work is validated with real flight tests using two desiccation crack patterns distributed across the surveyed area. Real-time segmentation from streamed camera frames of desiccation cracks is achieved through inference onboard the aircraft using a ResNet18 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and an OpenCV AI Kit (OAK)-D camera. Results from real flight tests indicate that the system can reduce levels of object detection uncertainty to locate and map desiccation cracks in environments under partial observability. The system design allows further adaptation for similar time-critical applications requiring increased levels of UAV autonomy in unstructured environments under uncertainty and partial observability, such as humanitarian relief, wildlife monitoring, and surveillance.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M. -C.

It consists of a driven strip monopole and several parallel near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) strips that reside on the surfaces of a hemispherical shell. The monopole strip lies on the interior surface; the NFRP strips lie on the exterior one. This arrangement facilitates the requisite stable near-field capacitive coupling between them over a wide frequency range. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to define the lengths and locations of these NFRP strips to achieve its optimized operational bandwidth around 700 MHz given its compact size. The hemispherical shell was 3-D printed with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin; the strips were applied to it with silver paste. This prototype was tested. The measured results, in agreement with their simulated values, demonstrate that it achieves a 17.97% −10 dB fractional impedance bandwidth over which stable realized gain values, near 3.5 dBi, are attained. With its low-cost fabrication and attractive performance characteristics, this 3-D printed antenna is suitable for indoor multipath wireless communication systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

This algorithm is presented both in its basic form as well as in a secured form in order to secure and maintain trust boundaries and communication within specific groups of heterogeneous devices. The specific target application scenarios includes resource constrained environments where a co-located swarm of devices (adversarial in mission or objective) is also present. CHIRP, and its secured version (S-CHIRP), enables complete peer-to-peer communication of a n-agent network of devices in as few as n rounds. In addition to the n-round cycle length, the proposed communication mechanism has the following major properties: nodes communication is entirely decentralized, communication is resilient to the loss of nodes, and finally communication is resilient to the (re)-entry of nodes.

Research on multi-robot system is receiving a great deal of attention in recent years. Multi-robot system has many advantages over a single robot in certain missions, such as reducing complexity, availability of redundancy, and reconfiguration capabilities. Using coordination scheme in multiple mobile robots allows them to complete tasks with higher complexity. The ability of each robot does not have to be very complete, since each robot can focus on a particular task. Therefore, in some cases, multiple robots working together to complete a certain mission can be relatively cheaper and easier to implement than a single robot. One of the main concerns in the discussion of multi-robot system is formation control. Having a group of robots moving in formation allows user to control the entire group of robots without the need to specify the commands for each robot. This is very useful in many realworld applications, such as search and rescue missions, surveillance, security patrols, military missions, and transportation. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the formation control problem : behavior-based approach to formation control, leader-follower approach, and virtual structure approach. However, in most of these approaches, there exists one group leader (either actual robot or virtual leader) that acts as the central coordination of movement for the whole group. This introduces a single point massive failure problem to the system, i.e. when the leader is disturbed, the whole group will be severely affected. Therefore, we need a distributed approach to overcome this problem. One of the most popular algorithms in distributed control community is consensus algorithm. The algorithm is originally inspired by swarming behavior found in living systems, such as flocking behavior of group of birds. Swarm behavior specifies that in a multi agent system in which each agent acts locally by following simple rules, intelligent collective behavior could emerge, unknown to each agent. Based on this idea, consensus algorithm directs each agent's state towards agreement on a certain value. In general, there are two strategies for formation control using consensus; distance-based control, and displacement-based control. In distance-based control, each robot must keep certain distance with its neighbors. This method requires rigid graph topology for the networked robots. In displacement-based control, each robot tracks its desired position, i.e. the desired deviation from a pre-defined formation center. This method requires all agents to know the formation center. In most cases, multi-robot systems should also be able to work in a dynamically changing environment. Therefore, we also consider obstacle and/or collision avoidance as additional objective while keeping the robots in formation. Two major approaches are employed to this issue : 1) the obstacle avoidance control and distance-based formation control is added (blended) to get the overall control signal, producing smooth movement of the robots; 2) Hybrid model, in which each robot is guaranteed to be in a certain state at one time, either forming formation or avoiding obstacle. In this talk, consensus formation control with obstacle avoidance is addressed using regulated hybrid model as well as blended model. Some theoretical framework concerning consensus, formation and related graph theory for a networked of agents are briefly discussed. We then describe layered architecture of the distributed formation control system that is useful for implementation in a networked of robots. In the blended model approach, a novel scheme is presented, which combines Social Force Model (SFM) for crowd modeling and consensus algorithm. Some simulation studies are presented to show the effectiveness of these approaches. Experimental studies of formation control of swarm of robots are described. The first experiment employs a group of mobile robots connected by wireless communication. The second experiment employs a group of humanoid robots using visual localization. Finally, future research issues are briefly discussed.</abstract><custom3>2015 2nd International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering (ICITACEE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Once removed from the energy management loop, the human operator is free to concentrate on higher level task management and data analysis. This paper firstly describes the design, test and construction of an autonomous Ground Recharge Stations (GRS) for battery-powered quadrotor helicopter. In order to incorporate the charging of the quadrotors in the overall swarm behaviour, the focus of the research presented here has been to reduce the charging phase of a single vehicle by developing safer electrical contacts and using a balancer in the charging process. The amount of extra current available from the new design easily pushed the flying-time/charging-time ratio of the quadrotors over 1. Then the paper describes a novel approach for the integration of this technology into an energy efficient multi-agent system. The development of a prioritisation function and queuing protocols between the UAVs and GRSs guarantee an optimised solution to the assignment problem dependent on the mission profile. Results show that the system's energy management remains efficient regardless of number and position of the platforms, or nature of the environment.</abstract><custom3>2013 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.

Mobile applications require different services when they enter or exit environments and as their resources change. In this paper, we propose a service oriented architectural approach that supports self-adaptation to changes in resources and location topology when mobility occurs, by reconfiguring the software architecture at runtime. The location topology and mobility primitives are inspired from ambient calculus. Our approach considers ambients to be autonomic elements that can manage elements located in them to their environment and provide them with new services suited to the available resources, when mobility occurs. Ambients implement a hierarchical and decentralized MAPE-K loop to adapt the distributed and mobile service oriented architecture to the resource requirements. We have designed an algorithm based on swarm optimization technique in order to allow ambients to optimally plan the reconfiguration process according to available services and resources. Throughout the paper, we use a scenario to illustrate our approach and perform initial evaluations on the swarm algorithm.</abstract><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

A typical scenario is massive crowd management of the multi-millions annual Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca where UAVs are widely utilized to conduct crowd monitoring by carrying sensory devices. The safe flight of a UAV is crucial for ensuring the successful execution of missions. With the aim to overcome the disadvantage caused by the ground station intrusion detection, the combination of UAV and airborne LiDAR has been widely studied in the field of UAV obstacle recognition. This article studies the UAV network architecture under a common scenario and proposes an obstacle recognition and intrusion detection algorithm for UAV based on an airborne LiDAR (ALORID). First, the preprocessing of the data obtained by a LiDAR, i.e., the coordinate conversion of LiDAR data in combination with UAV motion parameters, is completed. Then, the LiDAR data graph at the current moment is generated by the image noisy point filtering algorithm. After that, the improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used for image clustering of intrusions to obtain the LiDAR time-domain cumulative graph in a certain detection time. Finally, the motion recognition and location detection of each cluster are completed. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in identifying the moving state of the intrusions.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

However, selection of propagation models in FANETs is always a challenge due to its wireless shared links, individual drone’s mobility, limited power, etc. Hence, in this paper, we study propagation models for performance comparison of routing protocols in FANETs. Specifically, we study and present simulation results of Lutz and ITU Recommendation series to compare Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) and Destination Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV), two widely used routing protocols in FANETs considering rain attenuation. Finally, a plot of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound has also been presented in order to provide better clarity for depicting the performances of FANETs’ routing protocols.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE International India Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (InGARSS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

Furthermore, they can also have a significant role in the creation of future Quantum Networks (QNs). As a matter of fact, the use of drones allows deploying a non terrestrial Quantum Metropolitan Area Network (QMAN), overcoming Optical Fibers’ (OFs) limits, due to the large percentage of photons that scatters before reaching the receiver. However, random fluctuations of drones’ positions and atmospheric turbulence can affect the quality of the Free Space Optic (FSO) link with a significant impact on performance. Considering that Quantum Drone Networks (QDNs) require significant control, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm can play a key role in their provisioning. Specifically, an SDN Controller is responsible for managing the global strategies for the distribution of end-to-end (E2E) entangled pairs. Therefore, this paper provides the design of an SDN-based architecture for supporting high-performance Metropolitan Quantum Drone Networks (MQDNs) with a specific protocol for creating entanglement between two Ground Stations (GSs) through the swarm of drones. The proposed architecture can be employed for distributed quantum computing applications and entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) services. Moreover, a suited objective function to optimize the planning and operation of the swarm mission has been proposed. Finally, the paper provides a performance evaluation considering the most relevant metrics, such as fidelity, entanglement rate, and the overhead of the proposed protocol, pointing out that even higher performance than OFs is achievable.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Resilience of traditional monolithic spacecraft is achieved mainly through redundancy, which exponentially increases the complexity of their production, and therefore, their cost. One solution would be to use fragmented spacecraft systems. Redundancy is achieved by nature with local complexity. Furthermore, scalability of such a system is facilitated. However, data transfer and physical communication link between the “fragments” must be addressed. The main challenge of these systems is the management of the network of satellites. Traditional centralised networks, managed by a single entity, have been proven not to be secure, as they generate a common point of failure, susceptible to attacks. Traditional distributed networks, managed by multiple entities, require honest participants and trust between entities, restricting collaborative mission applications. In the present article, a design for a blockchain-enabled swarm fractionated system managed by multiple trustless entities is proposed. The system is composed of functionally different nano-satellites which perform tasks from different subsystems in order to replicate the functionalities of a monolithic spacecraft. The blockchain nodes are deployed in the satellites and allow sharing of sensor data between the network. A consensus protocol ensures the validity of the shared data. The proposed system has been implemented and evaluated on a local blockchain composed of four Ethereum nodes. We believe that the proposed application opens the way to new collaborative missions between entirely trustless parties, ensuring transparency and cooperation within the system.</abstract><custom3>2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

We aim to improve the battery lifetime of the drone with the smallest energy among the drone swarms. In addition, we analyze the success, collision, and idle probabilities of the swarming drone networks. In particular, we analyze the intradrone swarm collision and interdrone swarm collision probabilities.

Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is a channel access mechanism based on OFDM multi-carriers modulation technology. In OFDMA, multiple users can make use of the orthogonality of the subchannels to simultaneously access channel for parallel transmission. For underwater multi-hop network scenario, this paper proposes a MAC protocol of the joint relay selection and power allocation (JRSPA-MAC) based on OFDMA mechanism. The proposed protocol is divided into flowing phases: Firstly, the node determines the hop distance from the sink nodes and sends the request when there are packets to be sent. Then forwarding nodes election algorithm is proposed based on the channel condition and the delay information. On this basis, the sending nodes autonomously use the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to allocate its subchannels' power. Secondly, taking advantage of the high underwater acoustic propagation delay, the receiving node reasonably schedule the sending time, makes sure the parallel communication of multiple pairs of nodes in one handshake period. Finally, the destination nodes and the forwarding nodes acknowledge the received packets and completes this data transmission. The simulation results show that compared with the hand-shake based MAC protocols, the JRSPA-MAC reduces the probability of packet loss caused by data conflicts between nodes. In case of low power consumption, the network throughput are effectively improved, and the average end-to-end delay of the network is reduced.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jun Peng</author><author>Min Wu</author><author>Xiaoyong Zhang</author><author>Ya Xie</author><author>Fu Jiang</author><author>Ya Liu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Collaborative Multi-Agent Model with Knowledge-Based Communication for the RoboCupRescue Simulation</title><secondary-title>International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06)</full-title></periodical><pages>341-348</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>14-17 May 2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/CTS.2006.2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An effective cooperation model in a Multi-Agent system is required to enable agents to interact and achieve their task proficiently.

The challenge is integrating these systems quickly and reliably with efficient payload operations. While much work has been completed to define and make flight control and operations available as open systems, fewer options exist for instrumentation. Some options are available for specific domains. For example, ROS (Robot Operating System) is used for many UAV (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle) projects, but interdisciplinary use cases are non-trivial for projects that migrate payloads between UAVs and CubeSats or coordinate UAV and CubeSat joint missions. Common objectives and careful flight and ground configuration for both UAVs and CubeSats could provide a Common Instrument Stack Architecture (CISA). Many of the basic instrument integration objectives for CubeSats and sUAS share common requirements. The goal for the research architectures we are investigating, is to compare combinations of stack layers including: 1) the use of open source real-time operating systems (RTOS), such as FreeRTOS and Linux with real-time extensions, with 2) open middleware, such as ROS, cFS (core Flight System) or F Prime, and 3) image co-processing firmware. Previously developed and tested FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and GP-GPU (General Purpose Graphics Processing Units) firmware for sUAS sensor networks will be integrated with CISA for performance testing. Ideally, we envision this architecture working for sensor networked flight instruments (sUAS and CubeSat) as well as ground systems (e.g. sUAS traffic management and CubeSat ground operations). To start, we are installing and evaluating the leading open-source middleware options in use for both UAVs and CubeSats integrated with our multi-core, GP-GPU, DPS, and FPGA image processing use cases to assess throughput, memory, I/O, storage, and power consumption. Our intent is to evaluate the relative merits of the underlying hardware architecture by running our prototype CISA (Common Instrument System Architecture) on off-the-shelf multi-core, GP-GPU, and FPGA SoCs (Systems-on-Chip) that have flown or are proposed for space flight, are in use with UAVs and provide best power efficiency and performance. This reference CISA stack composed of an SoC, operating system, co-processing, and middleware is hypothesized to allow future projects to migrate instrumentation and sensor payloads from UAVs to CubeSats easily and efficiently. Migration would provide continuity and scaling for research and science missions as well as joint operations. Along with objective metrics such as power and performance, the project is evaluating subjective metrics such as simplicity of integration, configuration, and interfacing common sensors.</abstract><custom3>2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.

This paper introduces a novel cognitive communications system that can be fielded on small attributable platforms; the architecture amalgamates a highly capable environmentally perceptive aperture, a software defined radio, and sophisticated networking techniques. The proposed cognitive communications system uses the 5G new radio waveform and applies groundbreaking machine learning methods to facilitate systems orchestration amongst its subsystems to transfer information effectively between nodes, and across large-scale multi-hop networks, essential for rapid strike missions. With the challenges imposed by mature and readily available jammers, a cognitive communications system can be used to maintain and sustain continuous communications to provide near real-time surveillance and situational awareness updates. In addition to describing the comprehensive cognitive communications system architecture, a jamming analysis will be presented. Performance results for an operational use case will be compared to existing trite architectures consisting of siloed apertures and standard radio systems to demonstrate an improvement of approximately 10 dB in communications margin with the auspicious technology offering of the cognitive communications system for low size, weight, and power attributable platforms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

In previous work, we showed that a multi-hop line network can increase the range of the mission by finding the optimal number of relay UAVs, and their optimal placement. In this demo, we show that CSMA (typical 802.11's medium access protocol) behaves poorly in this type of networks due to mutual interference, and that TDMA is a better alternative.

More recently there has been effort to expand the role of the cognitive engine to address the needs of a network of cognitive radios [4,5]. Haykin [6] has demonstrated that there is a significant difference between a network of cognitive radios and a cognitive radio network. This paper addresses three questions: 1. What are the significant functional and parametric differences between cognitive algorithms that deal with optimizing the operations of a cognitive radio and cognitive algorithms that optimize the operations of a cognitive radio network? 2. What are the trade-offs in applying the various algorithms to each task? 3. Which algorithms are optimal for the networking tasks? This paper identifies a set of parameters that characterize candidate algorithms and explores the benefits and drawbacks of each for cognitive network tasks. We propose a tiered architecture of cognitive engine algorithms that work in tandem to optimize the use of cognitive networked radios for the optimal success of the networked mission.</abstract><custom3>MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

The Slocum glider is a buoyancy driven AUV designed for missions that can last weeks or even months. Although successful, its hardware and layered control architecture is rather limited and difficult to program. Due to limits in its hardware and software infrastructure, the Slocum glider is not able to change its behavior based on sensor readings while underwater. In this paper, we discuss a new programming architecture for AUVs like the Slocum. We present a new model that allows marine scientists to express AUV missions at a higher level of abstraction, leaving low-level software and hardware details to the compiler and runtime system. The Slocum glider is used as an illustration of how our programming architecture can be implemented within an existing system. The Slocum's new framework consists of an event driven, finite state machine model, a corresponding compiler and runtime system, and a hardware platform that interacts with the glider's existing hardware infrastructure. The new programming architecture is able to implement changes in glider behavior in response to sensor readings while submerged. This crucial capability will enable advanced glider behaviors such as underwater communication and swarming.

With the expansion of the application field of MWSNs and the complexity of the working environment, traditional network performance optimization algorithms have become difficult to meet people's requirements due to their own limitations. The traditional swarm intelligence algorithms have some shortcomings in solving complex practical multi-objective optimization problems. In recent years, scholars have proposed many novel swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, which have strong applicability and achieved good experimental results in solving complex practical problems. These algorithms, like their natural systems of inspiration, show the desirable properties of being adaptive, scalable, and robust. Therefore, the swarm intelligent algorithms (PSO, ACO, ASFA, ABC, SFLA) are widely used in the performance optimization of mobile wireless sensor networks due to its cluster intelligence and biological preference characteristics. In this paper, the main contributions is to comprehensively analyze and summarize the current swarm intelligence optimization algorithm and key technologies of mobile wireless sensor networks, as well as the application of swarm intelligence algorithm in MWSNs. Then, the concept, classification and architecture of Internet of things and MWSNs are described in detail. Meanwhile, the latest research results of the swarm intelligence algorithms in performance optimization of MWSNs are systematically described. The problems and solutions in the performance optimization process of MWSNs are summarized, and the performance of the algorithms in the performance optimization of MWSNs is compared and analyzed. Finally, combined with the current research status in this field, the issues that need to be paid attention to in the research of swarm intelligence algorithm optimization for MWSNs are put forward, and the development trend and prospect of this research direction in the future are prospected.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

This gland helps in the production of seminal fluid which is used to nourish and transport the sperm. One of the most common types of cancer in men is prostate cancer. A microarray dataset contains the microarray gene expression information. On a genome wide scale, gene expression profiles make it easy to analyze the patterns between genes and cancers, however the analysis of gene expression data is very difficult as it has a high dimensionality and low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, a transformation-based Tri-level feature selection using wavelets for prostate cancer classification has been proposed. For the input microarray data, initially wavelets are applied and then the essential features are selected. Then the standardized gene selection techniques are implemented such as Relief-F, Fishers Score, Information Gain and SNR for a second level feature selection stage. Finally, before proceeding to classification, a third level feature selection by means of optimization techniques are implemented. The optimization techniques incorporated in this work are Marriage in Honey Bee Optimization Algorithm (MHBOA), Migrating Birds Optimization Algorithm (MBOA), Salp Swarm Optimization Algorithm (SSOA) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). This kind of an approach is totally new, and the best results show when SNR with WOA is classified with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) giving a classification accuracy of 99.48%. The second highest classification accuracy of 99.22% is obtained when Relief-F test with MBOA is classified with Naïve Bayesian Classifier (NBC).</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.

In this paper, we consider the sum of all these devices as one emerging system (the swarm) and present an approach of a swarm operating system that on a systemic level manages these devices (local devices give up their autonomy) while providing a common interface to user applications. We provide a programming model for distributed mobile applications that abstracts from error-prone aspects such as distribution and concurrency by giving the programmer a systemic view to system resources. The model allows the programmer to define actions that can be restricted in space and time. Together with a high level goal, an entire application emerges implicitly based on those defined actions. In order to execute such applications, we present an architecture for a runtime system that uses virtualization techniques in order to execute multiple independently developed applications in parallel. The system follows a service-oriented architecture: one of the core services is the space-time scheduler that plans applications (a set of actions) in time and space.</abstract><custom3>2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

They are robust against failures and introduce diversity in the case of poor conditions. Cameras are used both for data acquisition and navigation. Additional sensors also play a role in the SLAM tasks (Simultaneously Localization and Mapping). The independent mobility of the robots/cameras leads to a situation in which the common field-of-view (FOV) of cameras changes continuously. The present paper addresses the task of acquiring and tracking the cameras FOVs. State-of-the-art FOV characterization techniques count feature points or do image segmentation. These methods are often not accurate or complex. We propose an adaptive common FOV detection method based on fuzzy plane clustering. The performance of the method is shown to be invariant under baseline scaling. An autonomous grouping algorithm is further proposed with respect to both distance of robots and overlapping FOV of cameras.</abstract><custom3>2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W.

These networks exhibit a rule-based architecture while each rule in the FWN consists of the premise part and consequence part. The premise part is realized by using C-means clustering method, while the consequence part is realized by means of wavelet functions whose parameters are estimated with the aid of the least square method. In some sense, the FWPNN can be regarded as a generalized fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN). Unlike Gaussian membership functions that are commonly utilized to implement the premise part of the rules in typical FWNNs, C-means method is employed here to overcome a possible curse of dimensionality. Polynomial neural networks (PNNs) are used to express the nonlinearity of a complex system. Furthermore, the particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the design parameters of the proposed network. Based on the PNNs and FWNNs, the proposed FWPNNs take advantages of these two neural networks: it exhibits the abilities to describe high-order nonlinear relations between input and output variables and it is beneficial to describe models impacted by uncertainty. The proposed FWPNNs are applied for time-series prediction and regression problems (e.g., control of dynamic plants). Several well-known modeling benchmarks including regression and time series are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed FWPNNs. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed FWPNNs result in better performance when comparing with some previous models reported in the literature.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Laboratory simulation for testing of medium to large UAS is attractive for managing overall program expenses and for removing the constraints on test execution. The benign dynamics of typical UAS along with the availability of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) scene generation software with good terrain datasets allows the Gray Eagle Modeling, Navigation, and Integration (GEMNI) laboratory and the U.S. Army Product Office for Medium Altitude Endurance (PM-MAE) to pursue a low-cost approach using a high-end desktop Windows simulator. The capabilities and limitations of this approach will be discussed. A general simulator architecture will be presented for the generation of synthetic video to model typical electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) fixed or gimbaled payload sources in applications where UAS are flying in standard airspace over mapped regions of land and at distances such that the map data resolution limitations are not significant. In the simulator architecture, a high-performance multi-core Windows desktop simulator is used to model the dynamics of the gimbal, emulate the software loaded on the sensor for controls, and host platform communications at rates of up to 512 Hz. Hard real-time simulation constraints and timing are allocated to hardware. The simulator interacts with the aircraft six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) simulator, the GEMNI Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) testbed, and the aircraft avionics data busses. COTS scene-generation software continues to improve as desktop computing and graphics technologies improve in performance and as the fidelity of data for Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) improves. Innovations such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED) provide substantial improvements over Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) datasets for vertical accuracy of GIS. Improvements in desktop computer storage capacity and the utilization of commercial drones equipped with high resolution cameras and lidar/radar is also allowing the usage of high resolution terrain maps in GIS. With these improvements in available data and technology, it is possible to design EO/IR sensor simulators that support the operational envelope of UAS for visual navigation applications over a wide geographical area without the need for a lot of site-specific GIS data collection and processing. An error analysis will be presented showing the coupling between the UAS performance and operating envelope to the GIS data quality and simulation timing errors. To accurately predict visual navigation performance in the laboratory environment, the sensor model itself must be accurate. With modern sensors now incorporating inertial sensors and doing master/slave transfer alignment from the aircraft platform as a way to improve their own navigation solution, these processes must be accurately modeled in the simulation. The error modeling approach will be discussed along with plans to perform model verification and validation (V&amp;V). Simulation development efforts also benefit from DoD and industry standardization initiatives. UAS designs are increasingly standardizing their datalink and video products around North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB), and Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) standards. The Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) is a standard that is finding increasing support within COTS/ Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) scene generator developers. Thus, any sensor simulation supporting CIGI will have some options for which scene generator to use for graphics rendering.</abstract><custom3>2018 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Therefore, power utilities are concerned about resolving the issue of electricity theft. In this regard, the data collected by Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) can be used to devise data-driven machine learning-based Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods. In this paper, a novel data-driven ETD method is proposed that firstly labels the electricity consumers as fair or malicious based on three analyses: intra-consumer, inter-consumer, and temperature-electricity consumption relation. After assigning labels to the data, significant features are extraction from data by introducing a new feature extractor that is based on Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) and sparse auto-encoder. Finally, classification is performed using two newly proposed enhanced classifiers, named as Differential Evolution (DE) Random Undersampling Boosting (DE-RUSBoost) and Jaya-RUSBoost. The performance of RUSBoost is enhanced using two nature-inspired swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithms, namely DE and Jaya optimization. The performance evaluation of the proposed classifiers is performed by conducting comprehensive simulations on real-world data taken from the UMass* smart homes electricity consumption dataset and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) electricity theft dataset. DE-RUSBoost achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89 and Jaya-RUSBoost achieves AUC of 0.95. The proposed classifiers have superior performance compared to two state-of-the-art benchmarks, i.e., Wide And Deep Convolution Neural Network (WADCNN) and grid search-based RUSBoost.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

There are primarily two reasons behind this development: the elimination of infrastructure support and the self-scaling property of P2P systems. The success of our system Coolstreaming represented one of the earliest large-scale P2P video streaming experiments. Since then, there have been several large-scale commercial deployments. With desirable content, these systems have the potential to scale orders of magnitude beyond the existing academic P2P prototypes. However, to transform this potential into reality, we need to understand the key design trade-offs and principles, as well as the design limitations of these systems. There are two main design decisions in a P2P streaming system: (i) How to form an overlay, and (ii) How to deliver the content. Coolstreaming adopts a gossiping protocol for overlay construction, and a swarm-based protocol for content delivery. While these protocols provide excellent flexibility and effectiveness in dealing with system dynamics and random failure, their impact on the performance and the system scalability remain less known. This paper takes an inside look at a commercial system based on the Coolstreaming, called Coolstreaming+. We explore its design choices and the impact of these choices on streaming performance. Specifically, by using internal traces generated by recent live broadcast events, we study the workload, performance, and dynamics of the system. Based on these traces, we show that (1) the churn is the most critical factor that affects the overall performance of the system, and (2) there is a highly skew resource distribution in P2P streaming systems, which has significant impact on resource allocation. We further discuss the impact of these observations on the system properties, and present solutions to deal with various design challenges. In particular, we suggest solutions to deal with the excessive start-up time and high failure rates during flash crowd, which are two of the main challenges any streaming system needs to address.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Under varying loads, the ability to tune the controllers of PMSM drives using optimal tuning time is crucial. However, direct tuning of controller parameters using estimated parameters or conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods do not satisfy the performance criteria. To solve this problem, the new method combining mechanical parameter estimation (MPE) and multi-layer particle swarm optimization (MLPSO) with K-means clustering (KMC) and an adaptive learning strategy (ALS) is proposed. First, the combination of an MPE method with a lookup table (LUT) for initial parameter selection is introduced to reduce the iteration time. Then, the MLPSO-KMCALS method is proposed as an improvement over the conventional PSO method by increasing the number of layers, grouping the swarm into several subswarms, and using the ALS for each particle to increase the population diversity and optimize the controller parameters within the shortest possible amount of time. Finally, a disturbance load torque observer is applied to compensate for the effect of external disturbances after tuning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments conducted under practical conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

To handle mobility, the MWSN node should be much more efficient than the nodes in static WSN. Moreover, a MWSN node should be capable of handling real time mobility control, path planning and navigation. The application domains of MWSN can be further expanded by incorporating swarm like intelligence in MWSN. We have developed a low cost, small form factor hardware platform which will function as a node in MWSN using custom off the shelf(COTS) products. Our mobile hardware platform, henceforth called as BSwarm robot supports self-assembly, to achieve complex tasks. The platform also support image assisted navigation and provides extensive I/O support for further feature expansion. The testbed consisting of multiple BSwarm robot can be utilized for the development and validation of algorithms/protocols related to MWSNs, distributed control of Swarm robots, real time image processing etc. BSwarm robot is a multi processor based robot designed in such a way that it can be used for applications which may demand varied degree of processing, communication and input-output capabilities. This paper also highlights major factors that can be taken into consideration while choosing the hardware platform for MWSNs so that the protocol stack development for MWSNs becomes easier.</abstract><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems (SPICES)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

For this new 3D architecture, a tractable model for aBSs' deployment based on the binomial-Delaunay tetrahedralization is developed, which ensures seamless coverage for a given space. In addition, a versatile and practical frequency allocation scheme is designed to eliminate the inter-cell interference effectively. Based on this model, performance metrics including the achievable data rate and coverage probability are derived for two types of aUEs: i) the general aUE (i.e., an aUE having distinct distances from its serving aBSs) and ii) the worst-case aUE (i.e., an aUE having equal distances from its serving aBSs). Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach emphatically outperforms the conventional binomial-Voronoi tessellation without CoMP. Insightfully, it provides a similar performance to the binomial-Voronoi tessellation which utilizes the conventional CoMP scheme; yet, introducing a considerably reduced computational complexity and backhaul/ signaling overhead.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

These swarms can directly contact via ground control station or direct communication. However, when communicating remotely via wireless and fine maneuverability of the unmanned aerial vehicle, many mechanisms face several security gaps, such as the authentication mechanism in enemy attacks. In this study, we propose safe and effective authentication mechanism appropriate for the dynamic environment of the unmanned aerial vehicle. In the frames of this approach, a new operating mechanism in the proposed protocol is described. The protocol provides authentication security for swarms of the unmanned aerial vehicle. Our scheme allows good communication and computing performance as well as storage cost.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has traditionally launched single spacecraft missions that are served by the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) pro­gram. Operations on SCaN networks are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and often each asset serves a single user spacecraft at a time. Recent movement towards swarm missions could make the current approach unsustainable. Additionally, the integration of commercial communication service providers will substantially increase the data transfer options avail­able to new missions. NASA science missions have found benefit in launching swarms of space­craft, allowing coordinated simultaneous observations from different per­spectives. Inter-spacecraft communication (mesh networking) is an enabler for this architecture, as are CubeSats that allow cost-effective provisioning of distributed mission assets. As more complex swarm missions launch, one challenge is coordinating communication within the swarm and choosing the appropriate mechanism for telemetry, tracking, control, and data services to and from Earth. Cognitive communications research conducted by SCaN aims to mitigate the increasing communication complexity for mission users by increasing the autonomy of links, networks, and service scheduling. By considering automation techniques including recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, cognitive algorithms and related approaches enable increased mission science return, improved resource utilization for service provider networks, and resiliency in unpredictable or unplanned environments. The Cognitive Communications Project at the NASA Glenn Research Center develops applications of data-driven, nondeterministic methods to improve the autonomy of space communication. The project emphasizes the development of decentralized space networks with artificial intelligence agents optimizing communication link throughput, data routing, and system-wide asset management. This chapter discusses the objectives, approaches, and opportunities of the research to address growing needs of the space communications community.</abstract><custom3>Advances in Communications Satellite Systems.

In an IoT-based system, WSN monitors different physical objects and forwards the collected data to the base station or gateway node for further processing. Existing routing protocols designed for WSNs are not suitable for IoT-based systems. An intelligent and high-performance routing protocol is essential for real-time data analysis and decision-making. Therefore, this paper proposes a mobile sink-based intelligent data routing scheme for WSNs. Initially, Particle Swarm Optimization is used for optimal cluster formation. After cluster formation, the optimal number of rendezvous points are selected, and a data-gathering tour is planned for the mobile sink. Furthermore, a mobile sink-based intelligent data gathering scheme is proposed to collect the data from the cluster heads. Extensive simulations and mathematical analysis are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The simulation results are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of stability period, network lifetime, throughput, average energy consumption, fairness index, data transmission latency, and message overhead.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

To mitigate the effect of these failures, fault tolerance becomes imperative. Nonetheless, it remains to be a second tier activity - it should not undermine the execution of the mission oriented tasks of WSNs through overly taxing their resources. We define architecture for fault tolerance in WSNs that is based on a federation of mobile agents that is used both for diagnostic intelligence and repair regimen, focusing on being lightweight in energy, communication and resources. Mobile agents are classified here as local, metropolitan, and global, providing fault tolerance at node, network and functional levels. Interactions between mobile agents are inspired by honey bee dance language that builds on semantics of errors classification and their demographic distribution. Our quantitative modeling substantiates that the proposed fault tolerance framework mandates minimalist communication through contextualized bee-inspired interactions, achieving adaptive sensitivity, and hysteresis-based stability.</abstract><custom3>2010 8th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The agents will be organized in clusters in order to carry out such missions; different clusters may execute different missions simultaneously. During the mission, the unmanned agents are supported by sensors on the ground and in the air, and can receive commands and send information back to a command ship, say. It is clear that efficient communications between agents, and from agents to sensors and to command posts are critical to mission success. The goal of the Minuteman project is to develop the concept and initial prototype of an agile, dynamic, multi-layer "Internet in the sky" architecture that can deliver the "forward power" of the unmanned missions. The architecture consists of a high speed, wireless mobile backbone network (MBN) - with point-to-point wireless links. and local access networks feeding to backbone nodes. The design is extremely challenging because of the hostile environment, the need for QoS support and the unpredictable nature of the requirements. The focus of this paper is on scalable addressing and routing in such a multiplayer mobile environment where UAVs can fly at speeds exceeding several hundreds miles per hour. We exploit the fact that agents typically move in groups, and achieve scalability by keeping track of a "landmark" for each group. This is done using LANMAR, a land-mark ad hoc routing scheme. The LANMAR scheme originally developed for "flat" ad hoc networks extends naturally to a network with a physical backbone. Via simulation we show that LANMAR maintains robust, resilient. rapidly restored connectivity in the face of agent mobility.</abstract><custom3>Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W.

However, the centralized control plane architecture of SDNs makes them vulnerable to harmful security threats. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud (SecSDN-cloud) architecture that includes user authentication, routing, attack resistance, and third-party monitoring. The goal of this paper is to design an SDN-cloud environment with integrated security that can resist three different attack types: flow table overloading, control plane saturation, and Byzantine attacks. A novel digital signature with chaotic secure hashing is used for user authentication, followed by an enhanced particle swarm optimization multi-class routing protocol to improve the quality of service. Controllers are assigned to switches by integrating an enhanced genetic algorithm with a modified cuckoo search algorithm. The malicious flow identification includes the analysis of five-tuples constructed from features extracted from packets. We implemented the proposed SecSDN-cloud in the OMNeT++ simulator and evaluated its performance in terms of packet loss, end-to-end delay, throughput, latency, and bandwidth.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

UAV ad hoc networks have the potential to provide reliable and real-time services using single-hop or multi-hop communications. However, the network topology of a UAV ad-hoc network is highly dynamic because of the fast flying UAVs that result in short lived communication links between UAVs. In mission critical applications, small delays could result in catastrophic outcomes. Thus it is required for UAVs to exchange their information as quickly as possible (with shortest possible delay). In this paper, we evaluate the performance of UAV ad hoc networks by considering the effect of network size on throughput, energy consumption and effective transmission range (total coverage range). Numerical results obtained from simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of UAV ad hoc networks. Our results show that when network size (the number of UAVs) increases, the throughput per UAV and energy consumption decrease while the total network transmission range (effective coverage range) increases.</abstract><custom3>SoutheastCon 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

In addition, such functions should take place with environments that are dynamic and not known a priori. This contribution reports on the mobile manipulator we are developing. We focus on solving the safe path planning problem for both the robot base and the robot manipulator in the presence of humans and dynamic obstacles: a safety distance should be strictly maintained by the robot with regard to the person involved in the interactive task as well as with any other person or moving object potentially colliding with the robot while performing the assigned task. These two requirements are achieved in real time by a multi-objective optimization that controls the base and the manipulator based on the task definition and the sensing data provided by the embedded sensors.

Devices in the overlay network such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are required to provide coverage to underlay devices as well as remain connected to other overlay devices to exploit device-to-device (D2D) communication. The coordination, planning, and design of such overlay networks constrained by the underlay devices is a challenging problem. Existing frameworks for placement of UAVs do not consider the lack of backhaul connectivity and the need for D2D communication. Furthermore, they ignore the dynamical aspects of connectivity in such networks which presents additional challenges. For instance, the connectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the network, e.g., the mobility of underlay devices or unavailability of overlay devices due to failure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work proposes a feedback based adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework for the overlay network that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network to provide reliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Results show that the proposed framework requires significantly lower number of aerial base stations to provide higher coverage and connectivity to remotely deployed mobile devices as compared to existing approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

A novel condition monitoring method for WT planetary gearbox is proposed in this article. This method can identify and predict the fault in the initial stage. Raw vibration signals are gathered from WT planetary gearbox through an enhanced piezoelectric self-powered wireless sensor. First, after the data processing back-end receives the original samples transmitted by the wireless sensor, the high-dimensional raw vibration signals are compressed and collected by adopting a random Bernoulli matrix to obtain the compressed samples containing the characteristics of the raw signals by compressed sensing (CS). Moreover, the operation of reducing the signal dimension not only eliminates noise pollution but also greatly reduces the overall calculation. Second, the training part of compressed samples is first exploited to optimize the deep belief network (DBN) by the chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization (CQPSO) algorithm. In the optimization process, the CQPSO algorithm can avoid local optimal problem better compared with traditional quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, which ensures that the optimized DBN architecture can extract distinguishing and deep features from compressed samples. Furthermore, the choice of compression ratio (CR) is realized in this process with the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) classifier. Third, testing samples are input into the DBN structure. A regression layer added on the last hidden layer, which stores extracted features, achieves the prediction of fault. In addition, LSSVM is exploited to distinguish fault types of features. The experimental results show that the modified wireless sensor can collect and transmit signals stably and achieve better performance in transmission interval and energy management. More importantly, the experimental results of prediction and diagnosis show that the proposed approach achieves excellent performance in terms of condition monitoring for the WT planetary gearbox.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

However, an efficient and reliable data routing decision scheme is critical for VANETs due to the feature of self-organizing wireless multi-hop communication. Compared with wireless networks, which are unstable and have limited bandwidth, wired networks normally provide longer transmission distances, higher network speeds and greater reliability. To address this problem, this paper proposes a reliable VANET routing decision scheme based on the Manhattan mobility model, which considers the integration of roadside units (RSUs) into wireless and wired modes for data transmission and routing optimization. First, the problems of frequently moving vehicles and network connectivity are analyzed based on road networks and the motion information of vehicle nodes. Second, an improved greedy algorithm for vehicle wireless communication is used for network optimization, and a wired RSU network is also applied. In addition, routing decision analysis is carried out in accordance with the probabilistic model for various transmission ranges by checking the connectivity among vehicles and RSUs. Finally, comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method can support real-time planning and improve network transmission performance compared with other baseline protocol approaches in terms of several metrics, including package delivery ratio, time delay and wireless hops.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D. -Y.

One of the most distinguishing features of FANET is frequent and rapid topological fluctuations due to the high-mobility of UAVs. Hence, the topology management adapting to the movements of UAVs is one of the most critical issues in FANET. In this paper, we study a FANET topology management problem that optimizes the locations and movements of UAVs to maximize the network performance, adapting to the topological changes while UAVs carry out their missions. When formulating the problem, we take into account the routing protocol as an arbitrary function since the network performance is inseparably linked with the routing protocol in use. We first develop two algorithms. One is the topology construction algorithm, which constructs a FANET topology from the scratch without any given initial topology, based on particle swarm optimization. The other is the topology adjustment algorithm, which incrementally adjusts the FANET topology adapting to the movements of UAVs with low-computational costs, based on gradient descent. Then, by defining a logical distance (the so-called topology edit distance) that measures the degree of changes in FANET topology, we develop an integrated topology management algorithm that contains the topology construction and adjustment algorithms. The simulation results show that our algorithm achieves a good network performance with low computational overhead, which is one of the most essential virtues in FANETs with rapidly varying topology.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

It provides two-way communication, either upon demand or on a continuous basis. An up-link provides control of the air vehicle flight path and commands to its payloads. The downlink provides both a low data rate channel to acknowledge commands and transmit status information about the aerial vehicle and a high data rate channel for payload data such as video, radar and navigation. In this paper we describe a novel secured, two way, high speed RF command and video data link system which enables real time, high speed, continuous data exchange between aircraft/missile/high dynamic vehicles and ground entities and vice-versa. This system uses advanced spread spectrum modulation, spread spectrum coding and decoding techniques to ensure signal security and multi-user access.

Rational planning of the quantity and positions of the chargers provide an effective way to improve the recharging efficiency and save the charger deployment budget. Existing work on RF-based charger placement mainly considers the situation where the devices are static, or adopt very simple mobility model. In this paper, we consider wireless charging service provision for wearable devices worn by users in a two-dimensional area, with users having a specific stay-move behavior pattern characterized by the trajectories, stay points, and stay time distribution. Based on this mobility pattern, we formulate the problem as how to find a charger placement to minimize the charging service budget, subject to the power non-outage probability requirement of the wearable devices. We further transform this problem to several equivalent problems for easier tractability and prove that it is NP-complete. Both greedy heuristic and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based solutions are proposed to solve the problem with certain approximation ratio. Finally, performances of the proposed solutions are compared with exhaustive search and existing point provisioning algorithm through extensive simulations. Simulation results show that both greedy heuristic and PSO-based solutions outperform the baseline algorithms, while PSO-based solution requires least number of chargers and thus is the most cost-effective.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

To implement this scenario on real UAVs and UGVs, we propose a distributed hierarchical hybrid system architecture which emphasizes the autonomy of each agent, yet allows for coordinated team efforts. We describe the implementation of the architecture on a fleet of UAVs and UGVs, detailing components such as high-level pursuit policy computation, map building and interagent communication, and low-level navigation, sensing, and control.

To ensure robustness, previous works propose sending a robot to the neighboring area in case it detects a failure. In order to add unpredictability and to improve on the efficiency in the deterministic patrolling scheme, this paper presents random strategies to cover the areas distributed among the agents. We evaluate these strategies using three metrics: the idle-time, the isolation-time and the broadcast-time. The idle-time is the expected time between two consecutive observations of any point of the terrain. The isolation-time is the expected time that a robot is isolated (that is, without communication with any other robot). The broadcast-time is the expected time elapsed from the moment a robot emits a message until it is received by all the other robots of the team. Simulations show that the random strategies outperform the results obtained with the deterministic protocol.</abstract><custom3>2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The design of the antenna is performed with a numerical optimization, to control the bandwidth and the impedance matching. A bandwidth of 5.53@33.185 GHz has been obtained, with a gain around 8 dB. On this design, a multiphysics thermal and mechanical analysis is performed to verify the operational stability of the optimized antenna, mounted on a 1U CubeSat satellite. The analysis verified that the antenna temperature patterns can affect the antenna matching, but it still allows correct operation in the [−100° C,100° C] temperature range. Moreover, the stress analysis reports a level of mechanical deformation which does not compromise the use and functioning of the proposed stacked geometry in a Low Earth Orbit space mission.</abstract><custom3>2022 16th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Through the integration of satellite networks and terrestrial networks, it can provide a better user experience and has become the core development direction of 6G networks. Inspired by the potential of service differentiation ability of 6G IEEE 802.11ax protocols (Wi-Fi 6), a Data-driven Fair-Hierarchical Scheduling (DFHS) is proposed in this paper to schedule packets from diversified applications in dense Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which allows data streams to fairly share the spectrum and at the same time satisfy delay requirements. Our DFHS is divided into the outer-layer and inner-layer schedulers. First, diversified packets of IoT services are classified into categories according to delay requirement and transmission frequency. Then the outer-layer scheduler assigns classified packets to different Access Categories (AC) with differentiated channel competition capabilities. Next, the inner-layer scheduler optimally schedules the AC queues according to the packet access response ratio. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is further introduced to solve the optimal packet scheduling problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the DFHS outperforms the classical FCFS, the latest EARS and Tian's schemes in terms of service missing ratio, queueing delay and fair index.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Service-level guarantees that are achievable in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can ensure reliability, availability and overall usability in any application. SOA can be useful in providing needed capabilities for the military in the traditional needs of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, information, surveillance and reconnaissance (often called C4I2SR). Military capabilities such as joint capability, interworking capability, COTS, organization agility, swarming, situational awareness and faster decision making are common applications that can benefit from SOA capabilities and each requires a certain level of quality to be successful. SOA provides the ability to dynamically locate and execute services within a composite function plan to achieve the desired QoS. A composite function plan is a template (blueprint) used to create a composite service. How to create the necessary structure in a military WSN is still a research topic to achieve the required levels of quality of service. We present a strategy that uses dynamic service selection to achieve higher levels in quality of service for WSNs, while preserving network lifetime. The realization of these strategies will be achieved through a SOA middleware layer in the WSN.</abstract><custom3>2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

If the data under consideration is an emergency message such as a fire alarm, it must be transmitted as fast and reliably as possible towards the sink of WSN. In such mission critical applications, it may not be enough to have one static sink but there will be multiple and mobile sinks. Sinks can be associated to first responders such as firefighters, but also to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The existing approaches have a high communication cost and a high delivery latency, which makes them less suitable for emergency situations. As an alternative to existing protocols, we present Honeycomb Architecture and Hexagonal Tiling-Based Data Dissemination (HexDD) protocol for emergency message transmission in mobile multi-sink WSNs. Simulation results show that HexDD has a high data delivery ratio and a very low data delivery latency, which are major requirements for disaster management scenarios.</abstract><custom3>2010 The 9th IFIP Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dae-Ki Cho</author><author>Chia-Wei Chang</author><author>Min-Hsieh Tsai</author><author>Mario Gerla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Networked medical monitoring in the battlefield</title><secondary-title>MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference</full-title></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>16-19 Nov. 2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2155-7586</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753145</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With critical data gathered during the battlefields, commanders are able to generate more plans and make better decisions more swiftly. Providing up-to-minute medical information such as physical and psychological fitness of each soldier can significantly help these decisions. The most of current medical information gathering system is in a format of speech or text. To collect this data with mobile devices and to propagate it to the commander, an efficient data transferring, low-power consumption, secure and light-weighted solution is needed. Previous solutions for on-site medical diagnosing and data gathering with portable devices did not address data transfer protocol, security and power-saving issues. In this paper, we propose to extend those local solutions to a dynamically changing, geographically distributed scenario using the battlefield soldier monitoring system (B-SMS). B-SMS is based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). With the P2P protocol, soldiers within a team opportunistically share their medical records. Soldier P2P communications can be via Bluetooth. The P2P network then elects a peer to upload the information to UAVs using wireless channels such as 802.11 or WiMax equivalents. The UAVs then convey the information to the commander either via multi-hop UA V to UAV communications, or in a delay tolerant mode, by ferrying the data to destination. To validate the proposed P2P + UAV solution, we study via simulation the data dissemination within the unit and the transfer to the base camp through UAVs. The B-SMS system will have the dual purpose of allowing the commander to re-organize combat groups based on physical conditions, and; the medics to prioritize medical intervention, thereby protecting soldiers lives, and supporting commanders strategic decisions. The time requirements of these tasks may differ. In this paper, we will also evaluate P2P delays and UAV transfer delays and discuss their impact on the applications.</abstract><custom3>MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

To achieve highly efficient resource utilization in SDN and offer users with diverse service requirements, virtual network embedding (VNE), which maps various virtual network requests of users to a given substrate network, should be conducted. In this paper, we study the VNE problem in SDN where the substrate SDN switches and links may be subject to malicious attacks. We first propose a hierarchical virtualization-enabled SDN architecture based on which the VNE strategy can be designed. Then, stressing the importance of network load and reliability of the substrate network, we formulate the VNE problem of SDN as a multi-objective optimization problem which jointly minimizes network load and maximizes embedding reliability under the constraints of virtual network requirements and the resource characteristics of substrate network. As the formulated optimization problem is a complicated multi-objective optimization problem which cannot be solved conveniently, we apply the ideal point method. In particular, we first propose virtual node embedding sub-algorithm and virtual link embedding sub-algorithm to determine the locally optimal solution to the two subproblems, i.e., network load minimization subproblem and embedding reliability maximization subproblem. Then, examining the distance between the feasible solutions and the locally optimal solutions, we formulate a single-objective optimization problem and solve the problem to obtain the global VNE strategy by applying discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The proposed  $e$ AP system controls the energy resources of IoT devices to extend the lifetime of the IoT device. For this purpose, we develop a new  $e$ AP system that considers a cross-layer design with a prompt TCP ACK transmit function, a caching-and-retransmit IoT data function, and a multiple IoT data aggregate function to improve the energy efficiency of the IoT device. In addition, the proposed  $e$ AP system has a device energy management module that precisely controls operating parameters, such as the transmission period of IoT packets, the delivery of traffic indication message (DTIM) value of IoT devices, and the transmitting power of IoT devices. These features extend the lifetime of the battery-powered IoT devices while satisfying service requirements for reliable IoT services. The long listening time of TCP ACK messages in receive mode (Rx) results in the high energy consumption of IoT devices due to the large round trip time. The proposed  $e$ AP system reduces the reception time of TCP ACK messages in the IoT device, using the prompt TCP ACK transmit function in the  $e$ AP. This reduces the long Rx mode time for TCP ACK reception, and increases the short sleep mode time, which results in increase of the energy efficiency of the IoT device. In the energy-saving analyses, we formulate an energy consumption model for the IoT device, and determine the energy-saving gain when the IoT device uses the  $e$ AP system model, compared to a legacy AP system model. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed  $e$ AP system achieves a maximum improvement in energy efficiency of approximately 88%, and 8.4 times improvement in the expected lifetime of the IoT device, compared to the legacy AP system model.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M. de Kok</author><author>J.

In swarm robotics, a self-organized cooperation is applied, where robots with limited intelligence cooperate and interact locally to build up the desired global behavior. In this paper, we are studying a mobile object tracking scenario performed by a swarm of robots. The robustness, scalability and flexibility of swarm robots make it an attractive approach for missions like object tracking in complex and dynamic environments. As the individual robot capabilities are limited in swarm systems, the robots may not be able to track the mobile object continuously. This limitation is overcome using the robots communication capability. In order to increase the probability of object detection, we propose a greedy self-deployment strategy, where the robots are spread uniformly in the environment to be monitored. For detecting a moving target, the robots use a biologically inspired algorithm for collecting robots currently located in other regions to track the target. In such cooperative tasks the robots normally need to be time synchronized for simultaneous activation. A new proposal for time synchronization in swarm robots is introduced which exploits the mobility of the robots for handling possible disconnections in the network and synchronize them at the beginning of tracking time slots.</abstract><custom3>2011 14th IEEE International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing Workshops</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The polymorphic control systems (PCS) project formalizes constructs that permits topological reconfiguration of control systems that span multiple heterogeneous systems and multiple communication mediums, towards the goal of control coordination and strategy optimization in a multi-system environment, increased resilience to failure and uncertainty, increased overall and individual performance, and better utilization of available resources. This paper presents the concepts behind PCS, and presents results from a flight test experiment involving distributed reconfiguration of an autonomous landing controller in a collaborative multi-vehicle environment.

Innovative methodologies and applications able to unlock such a huge potential are required. A domain where MCS really fits is mobility and transportation. However, for a full exploitation of this paradigm in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), distributed and self-management capabilities for the involved nodes-vehicles have to be provided. This paper is a first step in this direction, laying out an optimization system by exploiting feedback-driven patterns in a distributed-opportunistic way. In this sense, collective intelligence and stigmergic, swarm-based paradigms are adapted to an innovative decentralized MCS pattern toward new approaches in ITS. Their effectiveness is demonstrated through a traffic engineering case study, where route planning services are designed according to the proposed approach and then modeled and evaluated by Markovian agents.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

In the field of communication techniques for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAVs use sensors to upload collected data to cloud servers during various exploration activities, but UAVs can only store and calculate valid information currently collected due to the limited storage and computing performance. In the actual exploration, UAVs need not only to upload complete data to the cloud server, but also to support the data dynamic update efficiently. Moreover, due to security requirements, the privacy of data uploaded by UAVs must be protected. However, the existing auditing schemes for dynamic data and integrity have many problems, such as high computation cost, low efficiency of dynamic update, low privacy and security. For this reason, we propose a public cloud audit scheme that supports dynamic data and privacy protection based on distributed string equality check protocol and Merkle-hash tree multi-level index structure. First of all, a third-party server (TPS) is set between the cloud service provider and users, which complete digital signature, integrity auditing, and data dynamic operations significantly in place of users to reduce the local computing cost. Users then locally upload data which has been encrypted to the TPS. Secondly, to further improve the security of the scheme, TPS implement signature for encrypted data based on the distributed string equality check protocol. By designing authorizations with time constraints, it is guaranteed that only the legitimate TPS with time constraints can operate with cloud servers. Finally, we implement dynamic data operation efficiently based on MHT multi-level index structure. The security proof and performance analysis show that our proposed scheme is safe and effective.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

For the designed DLAA-VANETs, we investigate the UAV deployment and network optimization problems. In particular, a UAV deployment scheme based on particle swarm optimization is presented. Then, the NOMA technique is introduced into the designed architecture, which can improve the transmission rate. Afterward, we take the information security into account and formulate a downlink total transmission rate maximization problem by optimizing UAV height and subcarrier allocation. For tackling this non-convex problem, we decouple this downlink total transmission rate maximization problem as two subproblems, where UAV height and subcarrier allocation problems are solved in turn. Moreover, the transmission performance of the designed DLAA-VANETs is analyzed, based on which the security outage probability (SOP) is derived. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the presented UAV deployment scheme can maximize the relay coverage ratio. In addition, the proposed can achieve a higher downlink total transmission rate in comparison with the current works.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>U.

Meta-heuristic algorithms for feature selection have good exploration capability for optimal discriminative feature selection for fault isolation/classification of which the Binary Particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is superior to its counterparts. This study presents a robust approach for vibration-based failure diagnostics of electromagnetic/solenoid pumps which employ a multi-domain feature extraction procedure (statistical time-domain and frequency-domain features, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, and continuous wavelet coefficients) for capturing linear and nonlinear properties from the signals. Compared with other filter and wrapper methods for supervised feature selection, a hybrid filter-wrapper (Pearson's correlation-BPSO (ρ-BPSO)) feature selection procedure is proposed for global search of optimal discriminative (uncorrelated) features for fault diagnosis with an RBF-kernel support vector machine (SVM*). Subsequently, a practical case study involving five VSC63A5 solenoid pumps at various operating/fault conditions is presented for validating the performance of the proposed approach. Results show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid filter-wrapper approach against filter-based and wrapper-based techniques for discriminative feature selection.

To correct the lens distortion, existing methods use prior information, such as calibration patterns or lens design specifications. However, the use of a calibration pattern works only when an input scene is a 2-D plane at a prespecified position. On the other hand, the lens design specifications can be understood only by optical experts. To solve these problems, we present a novel image-based algorithm that corrects the geometric distortion. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: i) feature detection, ii) distortion parameter estimation, and iii) selection of the optimally corrected image out of multiple corrected candidates. The proposed method can automatically select the optimal amount of correction for a fisheye lens distortion by analyzing characteristics of the distorted image using neither prespecified lens design parameters nor calibration patterns. Furthermore, our method performs not only on-line correction by using facial landmark points, but also off-line correction described in subsection III-C. As a result, the proposed method can be applied to a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) camera with two fisheye lenses in a field-of-view (FOV) of 195°, autonomous vehicle vision systems, wide-area visual surveillance systems, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cameras.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Then a smart system is needed to detect threats and deal with them. In this paper, we propose a system structure composed of a central agent and three layers: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) layer, multirobot layer and sensor network layer. The UAVs act as moving sensors and conveyors in the air. They provide the overall rough monitoring data from the air and transport robots to the emergency occurring places. The robots on the ground are responsible for obtaining detailed monitoring data and dealing with the emergencies. The sensor networks keep monitoring the environment and assist robots and UAVs in the range to complete their tasks. The central agent can adjust the system according to the specific task requirements. We provide a general system design and review main required technologies, highlighting the challenges and some possible solutions. The future researching directions are presented to guide the system design.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

GWO showed performance improvement over all competing algorithms. However, the relevant literature identified that the primary GWO due to its position update equation shows superiority in exploitation, but is inefficient in exploration. It shows slow convergence and low precision, too. Motivated by the outlined issues in the primary GWO, this work presents two new and improved GWO algorithms. The first proposed variant modifies all the three models, encircling model of prey, position update equation and the hunting equation of canonical GWO. Further, a new parameter is introduced to scale the encircling and position update equations. As a result, the exploration issue of the algorithm is tackled. Unlike the first variant, the second proposed variant does not modify the position update models, but it incorporates Minkowski’s information into GWO. To the best of our knowledge, no such modifications to GWO have been done before. The proposed modified versions of GWO are tested on a well-known test functions suit and then compared with different population-based algorithms, including fast evolutionary programming and particle swarm optimization. It was identified from the simulation results that proposed algorithms outperform different algorithms in comparison on majority of problems. The sensitivity study of the proposed algorithms to their various parameters is also provided.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

For this purpose, a Local LSTM prediction model of each cluster is proposed in which the devices are clustered based on the features of the extracted data using an autoencoder. By adjusting the device transmission interval based on the prediction results, the amount of redundantly collected traffic in the LoRa environment is reduced. The proposed scheme is validated using a simulation-based experiment with the Intel lab IoT dataset. Here, we consider the physical characteristics of LoRa and the data pattern of Intel lab data. As a result, the scalability of the proposed scheme can be improved by 31% on average with a 0.3 MAPE prediction error threshold compared to the base model to which the proposed scheme is not applied.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Too many hidden layer nodes not only make the network more complex but also reduce the generalization ability of the algorithm. Aiming at this problem, an improved crow search algorithm is proposed to optimize the extreme learning machine. Based on the analysis of the limitations of the original crow search algorithm, a particle swarm algorithm search strategy is proposed to enhance the global search capability. In the latter part of the algorithm iteration, Gaussian function is added, and the penalty coefficient of the function is used for local disturbance, gradually reducing the amplitude of the search trajectory, and then adaptively adjusting the parameters to avoid being attracted by local extremum. Finally, the improved crow search algorithm is used to optimize the hidden layer neurons and connection weights of the extreme learning machine neural network, so as to obtain accurate prediction results. Through function fitting, regression data set fitting and classification data set for classification experiment verification, the proposed algorithm has higher training speed and efficiency. At the same time, this method is not only significantly higher than the traditional ELM method, but also obtains a more compact network structure, which is an effective neural network optimization algorithm.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jianqin Zhang</author><author>Zhijie Xu</author><author>Yanmin Wang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An intelligent traffic information service system based on agent and GIS-T</title><secondary-title>2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>2791-2794</pages><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>26-28 June 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/MACE.2010.5536501</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Advanced traffic information service system not only provide timely and accurate traffic information for traffic management personnel who can effectively adapt the traffic management control system to a variety of traffic conditions and road network capacity, but also help road users, effectively avoiding traffic jams, reducing traffic accidents.

Their use to enhance the provision of electricity enables the implementation of smart grids, where energy flows are closely combined with the provision of other energy-related information. The limited battery lifetime of the sensor nodes remains a prominent research challenge and limiting factor in WSN deployment. This paper proposes a joint constrained optimal sink placement and energy-efficient routing with the aim of extending the WSN's lifetime. The proposed solution is a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm that can be used for planning the deployment of WSNs in smart grids. The proposed algorithm involves a novel model of encoding the allowable sink locations into the PSO's particle-space. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to place the sink within the constrained areas while also improving the WSN's lifetime.</abstract><custom3>2018 International Conference on Advances in Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Although satellite remote sensing is an effective way for forest fire monitoring, satellite-based methods can only monitor large-scale forest areas, and they are weak in predicting the specific areas of forest fires. In this article, we first propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled system architecture consisting of multiple industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs), in which the data collected by sensors in IIoTs can be delivered to UAVs for processing directly. As the sensors of IIoTs are deployed to monitor different indexes of forest fires, fully considering the priority constraints among sensors can guarantee a quick response of forest fire monitoring. Thus, the priority constraints among the sensors are taken into consideration in this system architecture, and the objective is to minimize the maximum response time of forest fire monitoring. To search for the optimal UAV resource allocation strategy, a learning-based cooperative particle swarm optimization (LCPSO) algorithm with a Markov random field (MRF)-based decomposition strategy is proposed. The solution space of UAV resource allocation is decomposed into subsolution spaces according to the decomposed decision variables by the MRF network structure, and the optimal resource allocation strategy is searched by LCPSO in multiple subsolution spaces cooperatively. Three simulation experiments on two datasets are designed, and the simulation results compared with the state-of-the-art methods verify the validity of LCPSO, which are reflected by the quickest response time of forest fire monitoring.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

The proposed COMORL scheme controls BOs for CRE to maximize the number of user equipments (UEs) that satisfy their quality of service (QoS) requirements, especially in terms of delay and data rates. For this purpose, we developed a QoS satisfaction indicator that measures a violation of delay requirements by considering both QoS requirements and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In addition, we formulated a Markov decision process (MDP) model that is solved with a cooperative multi-agent online reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed COMORL scheme maximizes the global utility for load-coupled base stations. Our simulation results verify the proposed COMORL scheme’s effectiveness in terms of throughput, delay satisfaction ratio, and fairness. Specifically, we verify that the proposed COMORL scheme achieves a maximum of approximately 27% and 30% improvement of the delay satisfaction ratio, which is how many UEs satisfy their delay requirement among all of the UEs in a serving BS under medium and full traffic loads, respectively, in a dynamic scenario in comparison to the max-SINR scheme.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The SiL was assisted by the Flight Variables Management System (FVMS), a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that fully interfaces communication between MSFS and general purpose custom GNC algorithms. The originality of this new approach is to make the FVMS communication layer completely transparent to the designer so that full attention may be focused exclusively on guidance algorithm development and the debugging process as well. Furthermore, the application may be extended to both multi-engine fixed and rotary wing aircraft. When it comes to the design, development and validation of brand new control algorithms of GNC for unmanned systems, SiL flight simulation becomes an exceedingly useful tool since end-product may misbehave in-flight. It impacts over avoiding hazard situation of crew and population in the ground and on preserving expensive equipment of being damaged. To illustrate FVMS capabilities and assets on GNC systems design, a nonlinear path following algorithm is set up. FVMS GNC module is endowed with a full map interface and a mission management through which one may build/rebuild the UAV path on-line. The results demonstrate the potential of the framework on the implementation of either simple or more complex solutions for the GNC problem.</abstract><custom3>2014 Joint Conference on Robotics: SBR-LARS Robotics Symposium and Robocontrol</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The focus of this paper is to study the problem of information sharing and lower the communication overhead among different nodes for a specific data mining approach in distributed big data architectures. This problem can be abstracted as how to efficiently search under a specific cluster node topology. This paper proposes a new design rule for topologies including: 1) low coordination number; 2) high packing density; and 3) having a 3-D structure. According to this rule, a rhombic dodecahedron topology is proposed. A distributed banking big data mining framework based on the proposed topology is implemented.

By exploiting viable gathering of massive renewable energy data using the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a framework for improved highway-energy management based on the unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted wireless energy re-distribution of the harvested renewable energy. Combining both massive low-rate sensing with high-speed 6G-envisioned transmission for data aggregation, the IoT architecture is of multi-scale, consisting of: i) global data exchange and analytics for energy mapping, re-distribution planning and forecasting, and ii) local data sensing and processing at individual highway lampposts for micro-energy management. The feasibility of the networked energy system is analyzed via analytical cost-reliability analyses. The cost analysis demonstrates the cost-effectiveness through the lowest Requirement of Energy and Cost of Energy for the setup and maintenance. The reliability analysis reveals the energy plus (E+) feature of the system in certain conditions with enhanced reliability in adverse weathers that impact energy generation. With multi-scale data connectivity to intelligently manage standalone renewable energy, this work puts forward a viable idea of 6G use cases with massively networked energy sensors with a vision of achieving super-connected and intelligence-equipped highways.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

The proposed hybrid framework “Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration Aquila Optimizer” (CME-AO) is a unique combination of both deterministic Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration (CME) and a swarm based methodology, known as Aquila Optimizer (AO). A novel parallel communication protocol is also embedded to improve multi-robot space exploration process while simultaneously minimizing both the computation complexity and time. This ensures acquisition of a optimal collision-free path in a barrier-filled environment via generating a finite map. The architecture starts by determining the cost and utility values of neighbouring cells around the robot using deterministic CME. Aquila Optimization technique is then incorporated to increase the overall solution accuracy. Numerous simulations under different environmental conditions were then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Algorithm consistency aspects in achieving the expected results (area explored rate and time) is demonstrated through statistical means. A perspective analysis is then performed by comparing the performance of the CME-AO algorithm with latest state of art contemporary algorithms namely conventional CME and CME-WO (CME Whale Optimizer). The comparison duly accommodates all pertinent aspects such as % area explored, number of failed runs, and time taken for map exploration for different environments. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents two distinct advantages over the other conventional state of the art CME based techniques a) enhanced map exploration in cluttered environment and b) significantly reduced computation complexity and execution time, with almost no fail runs. This makes the suggested methodology particularly suitable for on-board utilization in an obstacle-cluttered environment, where other techniques either fails (stuck locally) or takes longer exploration time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The classification is based on information extracted from the network flow packets. This is a complex classification problem with unbalanced datasets and noisy data. This work extends the classic radial basis function (RBF) neural network by including it as a policy network in an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. With this approach, all parameters of the radial basis functions (along with the network weights) are learned end-to-end by gradient descent without external optimization. We further explore how additional dense hidden-layers, and the number of radial basis kernels influence the results. This novel approach is applied to five prominent intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, AWID, CICIDS2017 and CICDDOS2019) achieving better performance metrics than alternative state-of-the-art models. Each dataset provides different restrictions and challenges allowing a better validation of results. Analysis of the results shows that the proposed architectures are excellent candidates for designing classifiers with the constraints imposed by network intrusion detection.

Feature selection deals with the selection of the most pertinent features that also aid to increase the classification accuracy. The topic of feature selection is viewed as a multiobjective optimization problem with two goals: improving the classification accuracy and reducing the number of features used. Drone Squadron Optimization (DSO) is one of the most recent artifact-inspired optimization algorithms; having two key components: semi-autonomous drones that hover over a terrain and a command center that manages the drones. In this paper, two binary variants of the DSO are proposed to deal with the feature selection problem. The proposed binary algorithms are applied on 21 different benchmark datasets with five state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Lion Optimization (ALO). Different assessment indicators are used to assess the diversification and intensification of the optimization algorithms. When compared to current state-of-the-art wrapper-based algorithms, the suggested binary techniques are more efficient in scanning the dimension space and picking the most useful characteristics for categorization tasks, resulting in the lowest classification error rate.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

A two-phase control is devised which, under appropriate individual bounds, almost surely leads to successful rendezvous. We examine a likely and practical initial distribution, which leads to an exploration protocol wherein an agent is obligated to stay within a certain range of its initial position. Furthermore, the rate of convergence is primarily limited to the velocity limitations of the agents. We solve the aggregation and rendezvous problem with random initial conditions in an arbitrary, unbounded 2D domain without an a priori share coordinate system.

UAVs mainly communicate with mobile base stations, ground stations (GS), or networked peer UAVs, known as UAV swarms. UAVs communicate with GS, or UAV swarms, over wireless channels to support mission-critical operations. Communication latency, bandwidth, and precision are of prime importance in such operations. With the rise of data-driven applications, fifth-generation (5G) networks would face bottlenecks to communicate at near-real-time, at low latency and improved coverage. Thus, researchers have shifted towards network designs that incorporate beyond 5G (B5G) networks for UAV designs. However, UAVs are resource-constrained, with limited power and battery, and thus centralized cloud-centric models are not suitable. Moreover, as exchanged data is through open channels, privacy and security issues exist. Federated learning (FL) allows data to be trained on local nodes, preserving privacy and improving network communication. However, sharing of local updates is required through a trusted consensus mechanism. Thus, blockchain (BC)-based FL schemes for UAVs allow trusted exchange of FL updates among UAV swarms and GS. To date, limited research has been carried out on the integration of BC and FL in UAV management. The proposed survey addresses the gap and presents a solution taxonomy of BC-based FL in UAVs for B5G networks due to the open problem. This paper presents a reference architecture and compares its potential benefits over traditional BC-based UAV networks. Open issues and challenges are discussed, with possible future directions. Finally, a logistics case study of BC-based FL-oriented UAVs in 6G networks is presented. The survey aims to aid researchers in developing potential UAV solutions with the key integrating principles over a diverse set of application verticals.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

In addition, the geographic distribution of renewable energy sources forces scheduling algorithms with a hugely different communication link qualities. In this paper, we present an extension to the Lightweight Power Exchange Protocol (LPEP), dubbed LPEP++.

First, the node structure and deployment application of WSNs are analyzed, and the architecture of UAV collaborative data collection is designed. Second, the related models of communication energy consumption between WSNs’ network and UAV cluster, UAV cluster task allocation, and path planning are established successively. Then, a simple but efficient task planning strategy considering UAV forward and return distances is proposed. Finally, for the problem of model solving, the solution strategy of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed.

Those nodes suffer from limited processing capabilities as well as energy. They are also required to live for a long time; sensors send their data to the sink node through multi-hop routing. The sink node is responsible for making the appropriate decision based on the received data. This shows how critical the information fusion process at the sink node. Such fusion is affected by the quality of the collected information from the deployed sensors. In addition, information handling in the WSN is also affected by environmental conditions, sensors energy, and data reliability, which play important roles in the eminence of information fusion. This paper introduces an efficient environment-aware fusion-based reliable routing algorithm named E3AF. The algorithm takes different parameters into consideration, including environmental metrics, energy consumption balance among sensor nodes, and network and data reliability. The algorithm models the environment to allow the routing algorithm to avoid going through areas marked dangerous. The paper formulates the problem into an optimization problem, which is structured as an Integer Linear programming (ILP) to help grasp and obtain the optimum solution. Furthermore, the paper presents swarm intelligence as a heuristic algorithm when the optimal solution is not possible. In comparison to EFMRP, some of the used equations were corrected, and more realistic conditions and constraints were added. With extensive experiments, the proposed algorithm is evaluated and proved its efficiency.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

It is significantly necessary to obtain the safety-related transportation information of an area when vehicles are drove there, whether or not they are controlled by human being. However, vehicular content caching can bring issues in distributed-fashion, such as high response delay and low content response ratio because of the poor traffic condition and the obstructions of buildings. As a consequence, we adopt UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to assist the driving safety-related content caching for vehicles. Besides, since the power energy and the caching storage of UAVs are limited, it is needed to design an optimal caching scheme to guarantee the driving safety-related content demands of vehicle users as well as reduce the energy consumption of UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel deep Q-learning based air-assisted vehicular caching scheme to respond to the driving safety-related content requests of vehicle users. First, a three-layered content response architecture is introduced, where an airship is leveraged to take charge of the scheduling of UAVs to improve the content response. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is built to describe the specific problem of the proposed scheme. Finally, deep Q-learning is applied to solve the multi-objective problem by learning from the history content requests of vehicle users. Extensive experiments have been conducted which show the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of content hit ratio, response delay, being scheduling probability and packet buffering time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The basic concept of the behavioral strategies lies in the imitation of natural swarms of social animals, like flocks of birds, which are characterized by a global group organization acquired in absence of a centralized control. In particular, an on-orbit self assembly manoeuvre is analyzed. Since every satellite takes its own decisions being able to consider only a small number of neighbor satellites and limited intercommunication, full autonomy is achieved. However optimality in terms of control cost and required time for complete self assembly is an issue which is not even taken in consideration. In this work, the behavioral results are compared with a typical centralized control, with an active leader which is able to detect the position and the dynamics of each swarm member and to compute the optimal guidance towards the fittest slot around the leader. In such a way, the optimality of the swarm manoeuvre is reached, at the cost of a great complication in the system architecture of the leader. Special attention will be dedicated to the filtering strategies, in particular to particle filters, apt to solve navigation problems including a large number of close members, when measurements ambiguity can occur. An extensive simulation campaign, for various orbit configurations and swarm dimensions, is performed in order to clearly assess and quantify the advantages and drawbacks of the behavioral and centralized strategies.</abstract><custom3>2009 IEEE Aerospace conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Based on the spatio-temporal correlation between multivariate time-series data, we developed a novel multivariate time-series data encoding scheme utilizing the proposed time-series distance measure  $\textit {ADMWD}$ . Composed of two significant factors for a multivariate time-series prediction, i.e., the absolute deviation from the mean (ADM) and the weighted differential (WD) distance, the  $\textit {ADMWD}$  considers both the time distance from a prediction point and a negative correlation between the time-series data concurrently. Utilizing the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a subset of IoT sensor readings can be predicted from encoded multivariate time-series measurements, and we compared the predicted sensor values with actual readings to obtain the adaptive data transmission period. Extensive performance evaluations show a substantial performance gain of the proposed algorithm in terms of the average power reduction ratio (approximately 12%) and average data reconstruction error (approximately 8.32% MAPE). Finally, this article also provides a practical implementation of the proposed PBATPC algorithm via the HTTP protocol under the IEEE 802.11-based WLAN network.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

Under this perspective, enemy forces will seek to disable or disturb our autonomous Things and our complex infrastructures and systems. Autonomy, scale and complexity in our defense systems will trigger new cyber-attack strategies, and autonomous intelligent malware (AIM) will be part of the picture. Should these cyber-attacks succeed while human operators remain unaware or unable to react fast enough due to the speed, scale or complexity of the mission, systems or attacks, missions would fail, our networks and C4ISR would be heavily disrupted, and command and control would be disabled. New cyber-defense doctrines and technologies are therefore required. Autonomous cyber defense (ACyD) is a new field of research and technology driven by the defense sector in anticipation of such threats to future military infrastructures, systems and operations. It will be implemented via swarms of autonomous intelligent cyber-defense agents (AICAs) that will fight AIM within our networks and systems. This paper presents this cyber-defense technology of the future, the current state of the art in this field and its main challenges. First, we review the rationale of the ACyD concept and its associated AICA technology. Then, we present the current research results from NATO's IST-152 Research Task Group on the AICA Reference Architecture. We then develop the 12 main technological challenges that must be resolved in the coming years, besides ethical and political issues.</abstract><custom3>MILCOM 2019 - 2019 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

For small UAS, several operational rules have been established under FAR Part 107 (e.g., do not operate beyond visual line-of-sight, do not fly within five miles of a commercial airport, do not fly above 400 ft above ground level). However, there is no current means of enforcing these rules with a high degree of assurance. This paper summarizes testing of an onboard system - Safeguard - designed to monitor and enforce conformance to a set of geospatial limitations defined prior to flight (e.g., geospatial stay-out or stay-in regions, and altitude constraints). Unlike typical geo-fencing or geo-limitation functions, Safeguard operates independently of the off-the-shelf UAS autopilot and is designed in a way that can be realized by a small set of verifiable functions to simplify compliance with existing standards for safety-critical systems (e.g., for spacecraft and manned commercial transportation aircraft). A framework is described that decouples the system from any other devices on the UAS as well as introduces complementary positioning source(s) for applications that require integrity and availability beyond what can be provided by the onboard Global Positioning System (GPS)-based navigation solution. This paper presents results of analyses of flight data collected during Safeguard testing since initial presentation of the design concept at the 35th DASC (2016) and further development and testing at the 36th DASC (2017). Over this timeframe, numerous flight tests were completed on multiple unmanned aircraft (including multi-rotor and fixed wing) with each performing various mission types (e.g., infrastructure inspections, low altitude flights over populated/urban areas, and extended visual line-of-sight flights). Findings will focus on quantifying the performance of the system in support of validation of assurance claims, as well as demonstration of advanced technology readiness level (TRL). Integration testing with NASA's UAS Traffic Management (UTM) service-oriented architecture was also demonstrated during many of these flights; allowing performance results for this capability to also be presented. The paper will conclude with plans for future research and development, including evaluating the use of alternate positioning systems, extending the conformance monitoring criteria, and embedding the functions into a more holistic runtime assurance system concept.</abstract><custom3>2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Drones can self-organize into a connected swarm (Flying Ad Hoc Networks– FANETs) to complete various challenging missions. As the primary building block of Internet-of-Drones (IoD), FANETs have an important role to play in governing the autonomous movement of drones and supporting drone-to-everything (D2X) communications. However, factors such as flying characteristics and the highly dynamic topology of FANETs compound the challenges of packet forwarding; thus, the focus of this article. Specifically, a stochastic packet forwarding algorithm (hereafter referred to as SPA) is proposed for FANETs, where the data packets can be efficiently transferred to the destination. In SPA, the packet sender evaluates each next hop forwarding candidate drone based on different network metrics, prior to selecting the next hop forwarding drone according to the forwarding probability. In addition, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of SPA. Then, the link expiration time and link throughput are chosen as network metrics for network simulation experiments, where SPA is evaluated and compared with prior schemes (e.g,  $DTN_{geo}$  and GeoUAVs). The performance of SPA is evaluated in a real-world testbed to complement the network simulation experiments. Findings from the evaluations demonstrate that SPA obtains better performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet delivery latency, the number of delivered data packets, average link lifetime, and bit error rate.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The proposed FSRC scheme promotes relay operation with low spreading factor (SF) to improve the success probability for distant end-devices (EDs) and the fairness of success probability for each SF region. To achieve this, a theoretical framework for designing the relay operation is analytically developed by considering a practical LoRaWAN MAC protocol as an analytical model. The proposed FSRC scheme encompasses a selective relay operation by considering both signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio and the receive signal strength indicator value for the location-unaware relay selection strategy. Using this model, a genetic algorithm-based relay control strategy is proposed to maximize both coverage probability and minimum success probability for all SF regions by controlling the relay parameters, such as source-relay region and source-relay ratio. Our numerical analysis validates the effectiveness of the proposed FSRC scheme under various parameters in terms of the minimum success probability of each SF region, coverage probability, and fairness. Specifically, we verify that the proposed FSRC scheme achieves a maximum of approximately 37% and 33% improvement of the minimum success probability and coverage probability, respectively, under practical LoRa PHY/MAC parameters, compared to the single-hop environment (without relay operation).</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

To solve this problem, we analyze the influence of antenna pattern inhomogeneity and channel variation, respectively. The former mainly determines an antenna radiation function related to the yaw angle and relative position between the two measuring UAVs. The latter uses overlapping Allan variance to analyze and identify the measurement noises from outfield tests, that is, quantization noise, flicker noise, random walk noise and Gaussian white noise, which to some extent bridges the difference between the theoretical model and the practical measurement of RSSI. We also evaluate the sub-swarm size that guarantees robustness of RSS-based localization. In this way, an improved extended Kalman filter is proposed to predict and correct the colored noise by adaptively integrating the current peer-to-peer radio ranging performance and its Allan variance. To prove the effectiveness of this approach, simulation results based on real environment datasets and practical noise modeling are demonstrated.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

In this context, a crucial role is played by the so-called network reconfiguration problem, which aims at determining the optimal DN topology. This process is enabled by properly changing the close/open status of all available branch switches to form an admissible graph connecting network buses. The reconfiguration problem is typically modeled as an NP-hard combinatorial problem with a complex search space due to current and voltage constraints. Even though several metaheuristic algorithms have been used to obtain—without guarantees—the global optimal solution, searching for near-optimal solutions in reasonable time is still a research challenge for the DN reconfiguration problem. Facing this issue, this article proposes a novel effective optimization framework for the reconfiguration problem of modern DNs. The objective of reconfiguration is minimizing the overall power losses while ensuring an enhanced DN voltage profile. A multiple-step resolution procedure is then presented, where the recent Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm constitutes the core part. This optimizer is here intelligently accompanied by appropriate preprocessing (i.e., search space preparation and initial feasible population generation) and postprocessing (i.e., solution refinement) phases aimed at improving the search for near-optimal configurations. The effectiveness of the method is validated through numerical experiments on the IEEE 33-bus, the IEEE 85-bus systems, and an artificial 295-bus system under distributed generation and load variation. Finally, the performance of the proposed HHO-based approach is compared with two related metaheuristic techniques, namely the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the Cuckoo search algorithm. The results show that HHO outperforms the other two optimizers in terms of minimized power losses, enhanced voltage profile, and running time. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by the emerging need for effective network reconfiguration approaches in modern power distribution systems, including microgrids. The proposed metaheuristic optimization strategy allows the decision maker (i.e., the distribution system operator) to determine in reasonable time the optimal network topology, minimizing the overall power losses and considering the system operational requirements. The proposed optimization framework is generic and flexible, as it can be applied to different architectures both of large distribution networks (DNs) and microgrids, considering various types of system objectives and technical constraints. The presented strategy can be implemented in any decision support system or engineering software for power grids, providing decision makers with an effective information and communication technology tool for the optimal planning of the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of DNs.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

It not only speeds up information transmission between people but also expands the scope of information exchange, which has become an essential and important social media in people's social life. How to effectively identify and classify these online communities has important practical significance for the study of social networks. Correctly detecting the community structure of mobile social networks can not only improve the accuracy of friend recommendation, link prediction, service user positioning, product marketing, and other aspects but also provide an important basis for the monitoring of online public opinion. But the traditional social network cluster method based on the trust degree mainly calculates the user trust by analyzing the interactive feedback information between users. This method cannot effectively solve the “cold start” problem in the trust calculation process, that is, for the new network node, the trust value of this node cannot be accurately measured due to the lack of interaction with other nodes. Focusing on this problem, we propose a Gaussian pigeon-oriented graph clustering algorithm for social networks' cluster in this paper. A graph model is first built. Then, an efficient K-medoid algorithm is utilized to search the user center in all groups. The Gaussian pigeon algorithm is used to search the similarity between each user and the central user. Users that meet the similarity threshold are divided into the same user group. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method has better cluster effect than other state-of-the-art social networks' clustering approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

Steering is an extraordinarily selected network which is to an incredible degree testing as a result of its dynamic nature, compelled information transmission and power essentialness. Somehow, Swarm Intelligence based procedures, for instance, underground creepy crawly state optimization (ACO) algorithms have gave off an impression of being a better than average strategy for making directing algorithms for extraordinarily delegated networks. ACO based steering is a successful directing plan in light of the lead of seeking ants. Wireless Sensor Networks are portrayed by having specific essentials, for instance, compelled essentialness availability, low memory and decreased getting ready power. On the other hand, these networks have colossal potential importance, e.g., living space checking, restorative care, military perception or action control. Various traditions have been made for Wireless Sensor Networks that endeavor to overcome the objectives that portray this sort of networks. Underground creepy crawly based directing traditions can add an important responsibility to help the development of the network life-time, anyway this is only possible by techniques for a flexible and balanced computation that considers the Wireless Sensor Networks major confinements. The total lead of ants finds the briefest route from the home to a sustenance source, by proclamation of a manufactured substance called pheromone on the passed by centers. Taking after instrument from total understanding is associated with the uncommonly named network by scientists. In the going with investigation work, we have brought a couple of characteristics and also execution examination of the proposed A CO based extemporaneous directing traditions.</abstract><custom3>2018 International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

As this technology develops and is deployed for missions in Low Earth Orbit and beyond, the use of delay tolerant networking (DTN) techniques may improve communication capabilities within the network. In this paper, a network hierarchy is developed from heterogeneous networks of SmallSats, surface vehicles, relay satellites and ground stations which form an integrated network. There is a trade-off between complexity, flexibility, and scalability of user defined schedules versus autonomous routing as the number of nodes in the network increases. To address these issues, this work proposes a machine learning classifier based on DTN routing metrics. A framework is developed which will allow for the use of several categories of machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest, and deep learning) to be applied to a dataset of historical network statistics, which allows for the evaluation of algorithm complexity versus performance to be explored. We develop the emulation of a hierarchical network, consisting of tens of nodes which form a cognitive network architecture. CORE (Common Open Research Emulator) is used to emulate the network using bundle protocol and DTN IP neighbor discovery.</abstract><custom3>2019 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAAW)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.

However, the dynamic, complexity and openness of cloud computing bring unprecedented risks to the security and reliability of computing tasks. To solve the problem the new approach is presented. Firstly, the game theory is introduced into the delegating calculation, and the single-client and multi-server rational delegating calculation game model is given. Secondly, the Zero-determinant Strategy scheme based on delegating calculation is constructed through implementing the single-client and single-server rational delegating calculation protocol and Zero-determinant Strategy, and the conditions of the existence of Nash equilibrium of Zero-determinant Strategy is analyzed. Then, through the iterative implementation of the Zero-determinant Strategy, the participants will cooperate with each other actively. Finally, the performance analysis results show that the entrusting party can regulate the betrayers in the computing party through Zero-determinant Strategy to ensure the interests of honest people in cloud computing.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><titles><title>[Title page]</title><secondary-title>2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination</full-title></periodical><pages>1-1</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>31 March-2 April 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The following topics are dealt with: open dynamic distributed service architecture design; autonomous fault tolerant multi-robot coordination; object transportation; artificial immune system; acoustic head orientation estimation; powered wheelchair control; adaptive signal strength prediction; radio propagation models; multi-robot navigation strategies; omnidirectional mobile robots; distributive model predictive control; optoccupied poseable ball; underwater communication constraints; marine robot teams; swarm based construction; multi-pendulum synchronization; constrained agreement protocols; outdoor cooperative localization; cooperative robotic search; communication-aware target tracking; swarm pattern transformation; motion planning; mobile networks; graph-based distributed control; optimal multi-UAV convoy protection; swarm-capable autonomous agents; underwater sensor networks; UDP-based protocol; wireless Internet and distributed robot controllers.</abstract><custom3>2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><titles><title>[Front cover]</title><secondary-title>2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)</full-title></periodical><pages>c1-c1</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>8-9 Nov. 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/NTIC.2015.7368734</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The following topics are dealt with: MANET; target tracking; VANET; V2V communication; packet load enhancement; ad hoc routing protocol simulation; VolP traffic support; mobile ad hoc networks; path planning; fixed wing UAV formation; ARTI taxonomy; cyber-attack framework; enhancement optimized MAC protocol; block design multichannel MAC protocol; WSN; PAPR reduction; STBC MIMO-OFDM systems; 4G wireless communications; PTS scheme; SCADA open protocol PUR 2.4; smart walk mechanism; unstructured mobile P2P networks; BLE-based data collection system; Finger-Knuckle-print identification; SVM classifier; optimal object-oriented image classification; MLLH approach; image denoising algorithm; multireprsentation palmprint image; automatic personnel identification; optimized audio watermarking scheme; swarm intelligence; speech synthesis; Arabic language; model transformation; time-extended multirobot task allocation problem; Web applications; model-based approach; Chi-Square test; heuristic search; metamorphic malware detection; materialized view definition; semantic Web service; content-based dermoscopic image retrieval; and fuzzy labeled transitions system.</abstract><custom3>2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)</custom3></record></records></xml>
