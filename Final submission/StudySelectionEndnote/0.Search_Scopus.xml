They help improve the response time of the rescue team. They can cover vast challenging terrains quickly. Drones used in rescue missions are expensive. Because of the challenging terrains, if any drone crashes, it cannot be retrieved. This paper presents two contributions. The first contribution is a cruising scheme for a swarm of drones heading to a dangerous area to rescue victims. The proposed scheme guarantees the safety of the drones during the mission. It guarantees that no drone is lost; whenever a drone's controller fails, another drone will guide it home. Basically, each pair of drones should monitor the control system of one another. In case no watchdog signal is sent, an error is perceived and the operational drone begins to control the malfunctioning one (the drone with a failed controller). Every drone sends all its sensor data to the other drone every 1msec. When a fault occurs, the operational drone sends back the control signals to the malfunctioning one to control its actuators. A robust air-to-air communication channel between pairs of drones, is needed in order to realize the proposed navigation scheme and to achieve a safe cruise and a successful mission to every single drone in the whole swarm. Therefore, the second contribution is a channel model for the air-to-air links between pairs of drones. It is assumed that drones' transceivers use the 802.11n protocol. Simulations are conducted to test the proposed channel model in two scenarios. The first one is fault- free and the other one is when one of the controllers in a pair of drones, fails. The separating distance between every two drones in each pair and their relative velocity with respect to one another, differ in both scenarios. The proposed channel is robust as it achieves approximately zero BER in both scenarios.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: N.A.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the system performance for the Internet of Things (IoT) using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the disaster area. The communication protocol is separated into two phases: In the first phase, due to the resource limitation, UAV relays (URs) harvest energy from a ground power beacon (GPB) to support the communication process. In the second phase, the ground base station (GBS) sends the signal to the first UR by using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. It is noted that the first UR uses its energy harvested from the first phase to forward the signal to the second UR by applying the decode-and-forward (DF) approach. Similarly, the second UR uses DF to transfer the signal to two IoT sensor node (IoTS) clusters, i.e., near cluster and far cluster. Accordingly, we derive the closed-form expression of the throughput for the IoTSs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) with Nakagami-m fading and formulate a new problem of throughput optimization for multi-UAV system. For optimization problem, solutions are found using covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. The numerical results show that system performance in terms of throughput can be improved by tuning the UAVs’ altitudes and distances from the GBS to suitable values. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: V.-H.

Matrix-structured Manufacturing Systems (MMS) with freely linked production modules enable efficient use of assembly resources through flexible product routing. However, the high degree of freedom requires greater reliability of the production control system. Traditional centralized production control faces high uncertainty and computational complexity of flexible production. To address these challenges, this study proposes the concept of a decentralized logistics planning system based on agent-based modelling (ABM) and mobile robotic swarms. Decentralization will be achieved by treating robots and workstations as agents that can communicate and interact with each other. The rules of interactions and communications will be tested via ABM and, later, programming the rules into swarming robots to achieve fully autonomous logistics planning. This paper proposes a logistics planning framework with high adaptability and robustness for the matrix assembly system. We offer a hybrid optimisation-simulation algorithmic architecture to industrial practitioners to illustrate the steps and potential benefits of implementing self-organizing logistics planning. This self-organizing system can dynamically adjust logistics planning according to the interactive topology of ABM, which realizes flexible product routing with adaptability to changing production environments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

The solar sailcraft will have to navigate for about a year and a half between a departure orbit at 50,000 km and the distance to the Moon at 400,000 km or more. It seems that LoRa technology can be used for this Earth-Moon mission and the question arises about the advantages and disadvantages of using this system, from an energy point of view, the budget link and also its potential use for future applications in expanding Earth-Moon operations. Components are available at accessible costs, possibly using the educational modular hardware proposed by Xinabox. The LoRa (Long Range) technology offers a very good reception sensitivity, and standards already exist worldwide. The drawback of very low throughput does not seem to be a problem in the context of the Earth-Moon Challenge and can positively contribute to reducing the energy needs for data transmission. The proprietary LoRa technology is based on the spectrum spread modulation technique. It was developed with the aim of reducing the consumption of sensor network nodes and is experiencing a strong development in the field of Internet objects (IoT). In low Earth orbit, many functional or deployed nanosats projects use LoRa technology. A compromise will be sought between consumption and the link balance in the different phases of the mission. In the vicinity of the Earth, the existence of LoRa telecommunication networks in orbit (Lacuna Space, Swarm Technologies, ...), offers the opportunity to test reception without need for tracking from the ground station. At greater distance, the ground monitoring station will be the reference unit. From the spread of the spectrum of communication signals, physical information and low-throughput data can be implemented and adapted for the specific Moon mission, and new hybrid modules have to be developed to interface with optical systems, cameras and star sensors, the service module that will take the sailcraft to the start orbit, mechanical devices for the deployment sequence, liquid crystal control surfaces, and interplanetary science payloads. Here we present the state of the art and potential to use LoRa for the Payankeu solar sailcraft and other missions in the Earth-Moon environment, for the goal to reduce costs - Yes we can !.

The system comprises three main modules: (1) the virtual module, which simulates robotic agents, (2) the physical module, consisting of real robotic agents, and (3) the user interface (UI) module. To facilitate communication between the modules, the UI module connects with the virtual module using Photon Network and with the physical module through the Robot Operating System (ROS) bridge. Additionally, the virtual and physical modules communicate via the ROS bridge. The virtual and physical agents form a hybrid swarm by integrating these three modules. The human–swarm interface based on MR technology enables one or multiple human users to interact with the swarm in various ways. Users can create and assign tasks, monitor real-time swarm status and activities, or control and interact with specific robotic agents. To validate the system-level integration and embedded swarm functions, two experimental demonstrations were conducted: (a) two users playing planner and observer roles, assigning five tasks for the swarm to allocate the tasks autonomously and execute them, and (b) a single user interacting with the hybrid swarm consisting of two physical agents and 170 virtual agents by creating and assigning a task list and then controlling one of the physical robots to complete a target identification mission. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.

Traditionally, Resident Space Objects (RSO) are tracked and catalogued using ground-based observations. However, Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) is a promising technology to complement the ground-based observations as it offers greater performance in terms of detectability, accuracy and weather independency. A Distributed Satellite System (DSS) architecture is proposed for a SBSS mission equipped with dual-use star trackers and inter-satellite communication links to interact and cooperate with each other to accomplish optimized RSO tracking tasks while assumed to simultaneously perform earth observation tasks. This paper focuses on stereovision-based tracking algorithms with higher detectability and tracking accuracy in SBSS tasks in order to identify an optimal tracking solution for Space Domain Awareness (SDA), which could support future Space Traffic Management (STM) operations. Navigation and tracking uncertainties are analyzed in representative conditions to support the optimal selection and processing of individual observations and to determine the actual confidence region around the detected objects. Additionally, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is implemented on-board the satellites to grant the DSS autonomous trajectory planning and Collision Avoidance (CA) manoeuvring capabilities. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Conference name: 2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2023; Conference date: 4 March 2023 through 11 March 2023; Conference code: 188722</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152009437&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO55745.2023.10115786&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=14aa57c93bf80d66a72e1126112fc424</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Aerosp.

INSPIRE seeks to deploy a large number of small spacecraft (smallsats), arranged as autonomous swarms, to create optically interconnected network nodes around planetary bodies and their Lagrange points. It is envisioned that future scientific and commercial space missions along the solar system can use INSPIRE as their low-latency fast-data-rate connectivity provider. Each INSPIRE spacecraft is furnished with a set of fast communications systems. High-speed intra-swarm communications is achieved via omnidirectional optical links. The swarms act as autonomous network nodes that can form large synthetic optical apertures that enable high data rate communications among INSPIRE nodes. We see INSPIRE as the basis for the space internet and we plan to systematically implement this network to provide commercial and reliable connectivity to space users. In this paper we will present the architecture under development for implementing the cislunar INSPIRE. Chascii plans to deploy INSPIRE nodes along low-Earth-orbit and GEO as well as along Earth-Moon Lagrange points 1 and 2 to provide gigabit connectivity to future scientific, military, and commercial missions around the moon. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

The main strategy is to block the AALVs' line of sight to their goal zone (AALVs' objective), shifting its trajectory so it reaches a kill zone instead (UAVs' objective). The counter-swarm strategy performed by the AALVs consists of taking down the closest aerial units to the goal zone. As a result, a consensus algorithm is executed by the UAVs in order to assess the communication network and re-group. Consensus is based on the propagation of local observations that converge into a global agreement on a communication graph. Re-grouping is done via positioning around the kill zone vector or preferring an anti-clockwise formation to better close gaps. The adversarial strategy was tested in an empty arena and urban setting, the latter making use of a path-planning procedure that re-routes the AALV trajectory based on its current destination. Simulation results show a maximum UAV mission success rate converging to roughly 80% in the empty arena. When targeted elimination procedures are executed, UAV mission performance drops 5%, making no distinction between re-grouping strategies in the empty arena.

As a result, WSNs have been implemented to monitor animal care and track their health status. However, excessive energy utilization and communication traffic on packet transmissions lead to system deterioration, especially whenever perceived information captured in the monitoring area is transferred to the access point over multiple dynamic sinks. Further to manage the energy and data transmission issue, the energy consumption and location aware routing protocol has been architected on the wireless Nano sensor nodes. In this article, a novel hybrid energy and location aware routing protocol to cloud enabled IoT based Wireless Sensor Network towards animal health monitoring and tracking has been proposed. However proposed data routing protocol incorporates the trace file for path selection for data transmission to base station using sink node. Trace file has been obtained on processing the cluster heads established in the network. Therefore, clustering of node in the network has to be achieved using LEACH protocol which enhances the network scalability and network lifetime by clustering the nodes with Metaheuristics constraints like location or node density comparability. The objective of the proposed model is to enhance the network scalability and energy consumption by establishing the multiple node clusters with high density cluster head through Metaheuristics Node Clustering optimization techniques. Metaheuristics based node clustering is been obtained using Improved Particle Swarm Optimization. Further it is employed to compute the optimal path for sensed data transmission to base station. Node clustering provides high energy consumption among the sensing nodes and to establish the high energy clusters towards sensed information dissemination to base station on dynamically reforming the nodes clusters with respect to Node density and node location. Simulation analysis of the proposed energy efficient routing protocol provides high performance in energy utilization, packet delivery ratio, packet loss and Average delay compared against the conventional protocols on propagation of the data through sink node to base station © 2022 SCPE</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Z.T.

In this process, higher requirements are put forward for dynamic, cooperative, and highly adaptive drone colony organization. In this paper, the scheduling problem of hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems is studied under an uncertain environment. First, the system-capability-task organizational structure is defined and quantified, which lays a foundation for dynamic adjustment of the organizational structure in the future. Then, combined with the theory of flexible network and elastic network management, the model is calculated, and the linear transformation function and fuzzy theory are used to stratify and cluster the capability layers. On this basis, four motif structures are introduced for abnormal nodes in the process of dynamic adjustment, and a dynamic group reconstruction algorithm (DRA-M) is established. Finally, the time and communication load indexes are determined, and the alternative strategy is designed for the failure point. The performance of the classical scheduling algorithm is evaluated by benchmarking it under different conditions. The results show that the algorithm has a good dynamic adjustment ability in the event of a UAV swarm emergency, which is a bright light for the future study of highly adaptive UAV cluster organization. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: T.

The multi-UAV formation has higher reliability and can increase the mission success rate Formation control is the prerequisite for the formation to complete the specified tasks safely and efficiently. Considering the communication interference, network congestion, the article studies the formation model in case of communication delay and switching topology, and then designs the control protocol. Considering the requirements during UAV flight and the features of the motion model, the three degrees of freedom kinematics equation of the UAV is given by using the autopilot model of longitudinal and lateral decoupling. Acceleration, velocity, and angular velocity constraints in all directions are defined according to the requirements of flight performance and maneuverability. The control protocol is adjusted according to the constraints. The results of the simulation show that the improved formation control protocol can quickly converge the UAV formation state to the specified value and maintain the specified formation in the presence of communication delay and switching topology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: R.

UAVs inherently support features like mobility, flexibility, adaptive altitude, which make them a preferable option for dynamic surveillance of remote locations. Multiple UAVs can cooperatively work to accomplish surveillance missions more efficiently. However, the intermittent network connectivity and the limited onboard energy storage impose a great challenge on UAV-assisted remote surveillance. This paper presents an Energy-efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance (ECMS) system for surveillance of inaccessible regions. The system employs an optimal Multi-UAV Collaborative Monocular Vision (MCMV) topology to facilitate the surveillance with zero blind spot using minimum number of drones. We also propose an application-aware Multi-Path Weighted Load-balancing (MWL) routing protocol for handling congestion by distributing traffic among all available resources in UAV network and adaptively selecting the of source datarate (i.e. switching video resolution). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed surveillance system achieves coverage with lesser number of UAVs compared to the existing systems. It also achieves higher throughput, higher packet-delivery ratio, higher residual energy of UAVs, and lower end-to-end delay.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: C.

Battery-powered multiunmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) systems possess limited computation and communication resources, significantly reducing their functional dimension by limiting mission time and range. To address this issue, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL)-based intelligent and decentralized task offloading scheme for resource-constrained UAVs that can enhance the operational capability of the MUAV systems. Moreover, the proposed FDRL scheme can improve offloading policy quality while preserving data privacy in MUAV. However, such intelligent systems may fall prey to backdoor attacks that can intervene in the system's regular operation causing rapid degradation of its performance. We introduce a novel triggerless backdoor attack scheme on intelligent task offloading UAVs and analyze its impact to gauge the resiliency of the offloading policy in the presence of an adversary. Then, we propose lightweight agnostic defense mechanisms to combat such backdoors in multi-UAV settings. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed attack and defense strategies are practical and efficient.  © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: S.

Compared with single aircraft, the swarms have the advantages of robustness, scalability and information interaction. The safety of unmanned aerial vehicle swarms is crucial to perform the flight mission successfully for the system. When performing tasks, communication and navigation technologies provide basic guarantees for cluster collaboration. This paper introduces the research status and development trend of unmanned aerial vehicle swarm communication and navigation technology. Two typical unmanned aerial vehicle swarm wireless communication architectures are introduced. Most systems still utilizes ground stations to control unmanned aerial vehicle swarms directly, called infrastructure-based swarm architecture. On the contrary, this paper mainly introduces swarm architecture based on Ad-hoc network, and points out its development direction. As satellite navigation signal easily suffer from interference, several new autonomous navigation technologies which do not rely on satellite navigation are introduced, including bionic navigation, visual-inertial integrated navigation, and cooperative navigation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: R.

In this context, a crucial role is played by the so-called network reconfiguration problem, which aims at determining the optimal DN topology. This process is enabled by properly changing the close/open status of all available branch switches to form an admissible graph connecting network buses. The reconfiguration problem is typically modeled as an NP-hard combinatorial problem with a complex search space due to current and voltage constraints. Even though several metaheuristic algorithms have been used to obtain - without guarantees - the global optimal solution, searching for near-optimal solutions in reasonable time is still a research challenge for the DN reconfiguration problem. Facing this issue, this article proposes a novel effective optimization framework for the reconfiguration problem of modern DNs. The objective of reconfiguration is minimizing the overall power losses while ensuring an enhanced DN voltage profile. A multiple-step resolution procedure is then presented, where the recent Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm constitutes the core part. This optimizer is here intelligently accompanied by appropriate preprocessing (i.e., search space preparation and initial feasible population generation) and postprocessing (i.e., solution refinement) phases aimed at improving the search for near-optimal configurations. The effectiveness of the method is validated through numerical experiments on the IEEE 33-bus, the IEEE 85-bus systems, and an artificial 295-bus system under distributed generation and load variation. Finally, the performance of the proposed HHO-based approach is compared with two related metaheuristic techniques, namely the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the Cuckoo search algorithm. The results show that HHO outperforms the other two optimizers in terms of minimized power losses, enhanced voltage profile, and running time. Note to Practitioners - This article is motivated by the emerging need for effective network reconfiguration approaches in modern power distribution systems, including microgrids. The proposed metaheuristic optimization strategy allows the decision maker (i.e., the distribution system operator) to determine in reasonable time the optimal network topology, minimizing the overall power losses and considering the system operational requirements. The proposed optimization framework is generic and flexible, as it can be applied to different architectures both of large distribution networks (DNs) and microgrids, considering various types of system objectives and technical constraints. The presented strategy can be implemented in any decision support system or engineering software for power grids, providing decision makers with an effective information and communication technology tool for the optimal planning of the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of DNs.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 56; Correspondence Address: R.

With the technological development of autonomous intelligent systems, collective navigation has been an important application in the field of intelligent vehicles. However, many of the existing collective behavior approaches rely on communication exchanges between individuals and focus on the emergence of collective motion, which limits the application in specific mission scenarios and lacks robustness against interference. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel flocking-inspired approach of collective navigation for aerial vehicle swarms flying synchronously to the desired region. Firstly, flocking without communication is achieved based on bionic visual projection field (VPF), ensuring the normal operation of the swarm in communication-denied unknown environments. Secondly, each aerial entity is assigned a hidden identity as informed or uninformed, but only the informed agents are allocated information about the migration destination. Under such an architecture, the trade-off between informed and uninformed individuals in the group enables few-to-many control and fast navigation. Finally, simulation and experiments are both conducted within multiple scenarios, in terms of adaptability to different environments, swarm scalability, and robustness to vehicle failures. Results validate the effectiveness of the developed bio-inspired collective navigation algorithm.

The proposed strategy incorporates a novel parallel communication protocol, to improve multi-robot space exploration process while minimizing the computation complexity. This ensures acquisition of a collision-free optimal motion in a barrier-filled environment via generating a finite explored map. The framework is a unique combination of both deterministic Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration (CME) and a swarm based methodology, known as Aquila Optimizer (AO). Combinely known as Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration Aquila Optimizer (CME-AO). The architecture starts by determining the cost and utility values of neighbouring cells around the robot using deterministic CME. Aquila Optimization technique is then incorporated to increase the overall solution accuracy. Numerous simulations under different environmental conditions were then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CME-AO algorithm. A perspective analysis was then performed by comparing the performance of the CME-AO algorithm with latest contemporary algorithms namely conventional CME, CME Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (CME-AOA) and Frequency Modified Hybrid-whale Optimization Algorithm (FMH-WOA). The comparison duly accommodates all pertinent aspects such as % area explored, number of failed runs, and time taken for map exploration for different environments. A statistical comparison with both CME and CME-AOA is then carried out by performing multiple simulations under different environmental configurations. The mean and standard deviation of the (%) area explored and total time taken are then calculated. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents distinct advantages of enhanced map exploration in a considerably lesser execution time with almost no fail runs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: I.

In establishing drone swarms, secure communication between a fog drone and several edge drones is essential to mutually authenticate each other. Although many research works proposed the designs of mutual authentications, none of them meets the adequate security for the drone swarm environments, requiring either involvement of the ground station during the authentication process or expensive PKI-based crypto operations. Only a few works proposed more lightweight authentication, however, they are still vulnerable to key compromises in addition to the limited flexibility and scalability. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable authentication protocol for fog-edge drone swarm environments, enabling mutual authentication between fog and edges without involving the ground station. We also show the design can leverage various hardware-assisted security functions. Protocol evaluations show security requirements satisfaction while achieving 14–20 times less computation overhead as compared to PKI-based models. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: K.

Aiming to solve the multi-task reconnaissance planning by multi-UAV, a novel distributed task planning method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a distributed contract network protocol is proposed to achieve task allocation for multi-UAV. Comparing with traditional method, the communication load is reduced and the allocation speed is improved. Afterwards, an improved PSO path planning is carried out to provide a feasible flying path to the target. The planning efficiency is increased via introducing chaotic map initialization and adaptive parameter adjustment. Finally, numerical simulations for multi-task reconnaissance mission are given.

Nowadays, heterogeneous drone swarms, in which a small number of gateway drones (GWs) act as protocol translators to enable the mixing of multiple swarms that use independent wireless protocols, have attracted much attention from many researchers. Our previous work proposed Path Optimizer — a method to minimize the number of end-to-end path-hops in a remote video monitoring system using heterogeneous drone swarms by autonomously relocating GWs to create a shortcut in the network for each communication request. However, Path Optimizer has limitations in improving communication quality when more video sessions than the number of GWs are requested simultaneously. Path Coordinator, which we propose in this paper, achieves a uniform reduction in end-to-end hops and maximizes the allowable hop satisfaction rate regardless of the number of sessions by introducing the cooperative and synchronous relocation of all GWs. Path Coordinator consists of two phases: first, physical optimization is performed by geographically relocating all GWs (relocation phase), and then logical optimization is achieved by modifying the relaying GWs of each video flow (rerouting phase). Computer simulations reveal that Path Coordinator adapts to various environments and performs as well as we expected. Furthermore, its performance is comparable to the upper limits possible with brute-force search.

UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: G.

The central controller is introduced to handle the active smart distribution network (SDN) problems to maintain the voltage profile within its permissible limits, minimize power losses in different operating conditions, and minimize the energy wastage from the distributed renewable energy resources. These problems are formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. With increasing load demand and RERs in the distribution system, voltage coordination threatens real-time efficiency. In this research work, central controller-based Gorilla Troops optimization (GTO) algorithm is proposed to detect the optimum solutions for the voltage coordination problem. The load demand uncertainty and the stochastic nature of power generated from RERs (PV panels and wind turbines) are considered in the voltage coordination problem due to their significant effects on the operation and planning of the SDN. The proposed SDN has been represented based on the Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocol. It enhances the data and information transfer between the system-connected agents. A practical test system, NDEDC-24 bus radial distribution network from the North Delta Electrical Distribution Company and IEEE-33 node system are used to test and evaluate the proposed method. The results are compared with other well-known evolutionary methods. The proposed method obtains more accurate results than the other methods.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: B.E.

Drones are subject to a range of attacks, from GPS jamming to application bug exploits. Among these attacks, and irrespective to whether they have already been implemented or not, communication is one of the main contributors, both as a vector and as a target. In this article, we use previous work on security threats concerning drones to identify two main types of attack in a network of drones: intrusion from the outside and network usage from inside. We demonstrate the robustness of the Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture facing most common attacks from the outside. In addition, we propose a traffic injection detection technique and corresponding countermeasures based on SDN flow counters. Finally, we present an innovative machine learning solution based on Random Forest Classifier to address insider attacks, relying solely on flow creation events. We propose two specific features that characterizes the activity in the network. They allow detecting common network attacks such as denial of service, port scanning and brute force and are easily available to the controller. Detection performance of these abnormal behaviors are promising, both in terms of true positive and false negative, and in terms of detection delay. Detection of these common attacks will allow tightening of security in such wireless network by denying further access to the network by rogue nodes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: C.

In order to reach the ambitious Mars exploration objectives set out for the coming decades, a significant reduction of cost, risk and schedule is needed. Additionally, many current science objectives, such as improving models of Martian weather and climate as well as internal structure, require long-term surface data over large areas of Mars. We propose a mission architecture based on a swarm of wind-driven rovers that can provide these types of observations, while also reducing high mission cost and risk for Martian exploration. Following mid-air deployment, the rovers unfold and touch down on the surface, roll across the surface until a desired spread of the rovers is achieved, and are then stopped. Scientific data is collected both on-the-roll and when stationary. The Tumbleweed mission provides a unique opportunity to characterize Mars using data over various spatial and temporal scales. We show that a Tumbleweed mission has high utility with respect to Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) Goal II (Climate on Mars) by providing environmental data including temperature, pressure and wind velocity. Goal III (Martian Geology) is addressed by providing highly precise geodetic data and assisting in gravimetric measurements. Moreover, Goal IV (Human Exploration) is fulfilled by surveying large surfaces of Mars, adding crucial context to the current understanding of the Martian environment. With a sensor package consisting of a radio beacon, laser retro-reflector, atmospheric sensors and a rudimentary camera the Tumbleweed mission can address objectives relating to all three aforementioned high-level MEPAG goals. While many aspects of the mission can rely on already-proven technology, further development is needed on a miniaturized location determination system, the folding mechanics of the rover structure, and the rover's power systems. To gain further insight, a half-scale demonstrator of the rover has been constructed and tested in a Mars analogous environment. The results of the test show the general feasibility of the rover and have provided validation of visual instruments. Moreover, a novel reversible, non-destructive method for arresting the rover through reefing sails has been demonstrated. Visual data can be used to further develop a locating algorithm. Another avenue for future research is the communication with the swarm of rolling rovers on the surface of Mars which warrants unique communication strategies.

The swarm can consist of many small-size aerial, ground, or space vehicles (or robots) and they may be interconnected through data links or communication networks to perform common tasks. The interconnected AV systems may each have coupled mechanical-electromagnetic dynamics, aerodynamics, thermal dynamics and control interactions. This d-HIL testbed facilitates the easy connections of real-time simulation models implemented on different hardware or at different locations, controller hardware at a remote or field location, and simulated or real hardware systems under test. A human operator can also be connected into the simulation loop to provide input to the test procedure. Testing of these functional components in a high-fidelity virtual environment will help make corrections or refinement to the control algorithms and software with high confidence before moving to field test and overcome the cost and safety concerns. This platform is based upon heterogeneous computing hardware, such as real-time multi-core processors and FPGA (field programmable gate array), and open-source simulation packages such as PX4 and ROS2. The developed software consists of computational modules for dynamic simulation, control implementation, data visualization, and data communications through different network protocols. The testbed is applicable to rapid virtual testing of networked dynamic systems such as aerospace systems, swarms of drones/ robots, microgrids, etc. In the dynamic simulation, mathematical models of different components can be solved by a set of multi-rate computational solvers and running on hardware units with different simulation time steps, depending on the model’s time scale. These innovative computational solvers can find the solutions to various transient physical phenomena or processes based on the first principles, or capture and quantify the input-output relationships based on machine learning models. Several case studies will demonstrate the use of this platform in coordinated simulation of swarms of drones and robots and show the results of different simulation scenarios, involving several key components in autonomous flight or robot missions. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

UAVs mainly communicate with mobile base stations, ground stations (GS), or networked peer UAVs, known as UAV swarms. UAVs communicate with GS, or UAV swarms, over wireless channels to support mission-critical operations. Communication latency, bandwidth, and precision are of prime importance in such operations. With the rise of data-driven applications, fifth-generation (5G) networks would face bottlenecks to communicate at near-real-time, at low latency and improved coverage. Thus, researchers have shifted towards network designs that incorporate beyond 5G (B5G) networks for UAV designs. However, UAVs are resource-constrained, with limited power and battery, and thus centralized cloud-centric models are not suitable. Moreover, as exchanged data is through open channels, privacy and security issues exist. Federated learning (FL) allows data to be trained on local nodes, preserving privacy and improving network communication. However, sharing of local updates is required through a trusted consensus mechanism. Thus, blockchain (BC)-based FL schemes for UAVs allow trusted exchange of FL updates among UAV swarms and GS. To date, limited research has been carried out on the integration of BC and FL in UAV management. The proposed survey addresses the gap and presents a solution taxonomy of BC-based FL in UAVs for B5G networks due to the open problem. This paper presents a reference architecture and compares its potential benefits over traditional BC-based UAV networks. Open issues and challenges are discussed, with possible future directions. Finally, a logistics case study of BC-based FL-oriented UAVs in 6G networks is presented. The survey aims to aid researchers in developing potential UAV solutions with the key integrating principles over a diverse set of application verticals.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 27; Correspondence Address: P.

However, the fast mobility and highly dynamic network topology pose unique challenges and require the development of novel multi-hop routing protocols. Previous work in this direction extends geographical protocols or adapts approaches designed for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), rarely taking full advantage of UAV capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel data offloading approach, namely Stop &amp; Offload, that exploits the device controllable mobility to facilitate network routing. The swarm of UAVs performs data offloading synchronously and recurrently. At fixed intervals of time, the swarm interrupts the sensing mission (Stop) and moves, as little as possible, to build a connected formation to the base station and offload the data (Offload). We provide both centralized solutions — assuming a long-range control channel — and a distributed solution — working in the absence of a control channel. By means of extensive simulations we show that our proposals outperform state-of-the-art solutions, decreasing the time taken to build a connected formation of about 45% and increasing the time spent on sensing of 10%. Additionally, we compared our protocol with various routing strategies and observe remarkable improvements, including a 50% reduction in average packet delay. © 2023 The Author(s)</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: N.

Growth in kind of applications resulted in increasing the scope of wireless communication and allocating a spectrum, as well as methods to decrease the intervention between nearby-located wireless links functioning on the same spectrum bands and hence to proliferation for the spectral efficiency. Recent advancement in drone technology has evolved quickly leading on board sensors with increased energy, storage, communication and processing capabilities. In future, the drone sensor networks will be more common and energy utilization will play a crucial role to maintain a fully functional network for the longest period of time. Envisioning the aerial drone network, this study proposes a robust high level design of algorithms for the drones (group coordination). The proposed design is validated with two algorithms using multiple drones consisting of various on-board sensors. In addition, this paper also discusses the challenges involved in designing solutions. The result obtained through proposed method outperforms the traditional techniques with the transfer rate of more than 3 MB for data transfer in the drone with coordination Design/methodology/approach: Fair Scheduling Algorithm (FSA) using a queue is a distributed slot assignment algorithm. The FSA executes in rounds. The duration of each round is dynamic based upon the delay in the network. FSA prevents the collision by ensuring that none of the neighboring node gets the same slot. Nodes (Arivudainambi et al., 2019) which are separated by two or more hopes can get assigned in the same slot, thereby preventing the collision. To achieve fairness at the scheduling level, the FSA maintains four different states for each node as IDLE, REQUEST, GRANT and RELEASE. Findings: A multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system can operate in both centralized and decentralized manner. In a centralized system, the ground control system will take care of drone data collection, decisions on navigation, task updation, etc. In a decentralized system, the UAVs are unambiguously collaborating on various levels as mentioned in the centralized system to achieve the goal which is represented in Figure 2. Research limitations/implications: However, the multi-UAVs are context aware in situations such as environmental observation, UAV–UAV communication and decision-making. Independent of whether operation is centralized or decentralized, this study relates the goals of the multi-UAVs are sensing, communication and coordination among other UAVs, etc. Figure 3 shows overall system architecture. Practical implications: The individual events attempts in the UAV’s execution are required to complete the mission in superlative manner which affects in every multi UAV system. This multi UAV systems need to take a steady resolute on what way UAV has to travel and what they need to complete to face the critical situations in changing of environments with the uncertain information. This coordination algorithm has certain dimensions including events that they needs to resolute on, the information that they used to make a resolution, the resolute making algorithm, the degree of decentralization. In multi UAV systems, the coordinated events ranges from lower motion level. Originality/value: This study has proposed a novel self-organizing coordination algorithm for multi-UAV systems. Further, the experimental results also confirm that is robust to form network at ease. The testbed for this simulation to sensing, communication, evaluation and networking. The algorithm coordination has to testbed with multi UAVs systems. The two scheduling techniques has been used to transfer the packets using done network. The self-organizing algorithm (SOA) with fair scheduling queue outperforms the weighted queue scheduling in the transfer rate with less loss and time lag. The results obtained through from Figure 10 clearly indicates that the fair queue scheduling with SOA have several advantages over weighted fair queue in different parameters. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: K.A.

A promising solution for emergency response is establishing self-organizing networks with flexible unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) swarms to provide a communication guarantee for rescue mission execution. However, the server environment of the disaster area and the highly dynamic characteristic of UAV networks place strict requirements on swarm mobility control and data transmission. To this end, this work proposes a Boids mobility model-based adaptive routing scheme to achieve efficient UAV swarm networking. Specifically, we develop a biological-inspired Boids-based Social Force Model (BSFM) to implement swarm mobility control with location information and link states to improve the communication performance of UAV networks. Then, we design an adaptive routing scheme to adjust the Hello message sending interval based on the relative velocity and distance between the UAV s for neighbor discovery and topology maintenance. We conduct experiments with Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) for performance evaluation, and simulation results show that our method outperforms conventional approaches regarding the average delay, packet loss ratio, and network throughput.  © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

Multi-UAV systems are preferred to single-UAV systems, as they are more efficient and cost-effective when completing missions collaboratively. However, like other ad-hoc networks, UAV networks face the challenge of effective communication. Existing research in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) does not fully address the unique characteristics of UAV networks, which can exhibit varying levels of dynamism, intermittent links, and fluid topology. Moreover, drones need to communicate with each other and ground stations in Flying Ad-hoc Networks. Therefore, routing protocols in such networks must select the most effective paths for communication while ensuring reliable and stable data transmission. This article examines several recently developed routing protocols in UAV communication, detailing their construction methods. As routing is quite challenging in UAVs, where communication performance depends on various factors, this research introduces performance metrics to analyze the efficiency of these protocols. Routing protocols in UAV networks must adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. Since the lifespan of UAV nodes is limited, seamless handovers are crucial, and the energy efficiency of protocols at different layers should also be considered. Although the reviewed protocols address several aspects of designing routing protocols for UAV communication, some challenges remain. Thus, this article provides a comprehensive exploration of routing protocols in UAV communication, along with a discussion of some open research areas. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

To address the imbalance problem of network overhead and limited energy of underwater sensor nodes, this paper presents a CH–SH Selection and Sink Path-planning (CSSP) scheme to collect vast amount of data from heterogeneous sensor nodes. The scheme firstly establishes a three-layer network structure model for underwater mobile sensor networks (UMSN) based on multi-mode communication mechanism and provides energy-balanced head nodes (cluster head and sub-cluster head nodes) selection algorithm based on particle swarm iterative optimization. Then, the optimal global-path-plan of mobile sink is proposed to visit all the head nodes to collect data, reduce the multi-hop underwater acoustic transmission distance of relay nodes, and avoid the energy hole problem. Lastly, the upper-layer multi-hop network of UMSN is designed to remotely control local-path-plan over mobile sink, in order to implement joint planning of global and local paths of mobile sink. Simulation results verified that the proposed CSSP scheme outperformed 11%, 16% and 22% over three typical protocols in terms of nodes energy consumption, CSSP was 9%, 12% and 19% lower than three typical protocols in terms of SD of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio of CSSP was 8%, 10% and 12% higher than three typical protocols. The scheme could significantly balance energy and reduce packet loss rate. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: Y.

We consider agents that can receive global commands from a high-level planner, but no inter-agent communication. Moreover, agents are grouped into sub-swarms whose number can vary over the mission time horizon due to splitting and merging. However, a strict upper bound on the maximum number of sub-swarms is imposed to ensure their safe operation in the environment. We propose a two-phase approach. In the first phase, we compute the trajectories of the sub-swarms, splitting, and merging actions using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming approach that ensures the satisfaction of the MTL specification with minimal swarm division over the mission time horizon. Moreover, it enforces the upper bound on the number of sub-swarms. In the second phase, splitting fractions for sub-swarms resulting from splitting actions are computed. A distributed randomized protocol with no interagent communication ensures agent assignments matching the splitting fractions. Finally, we show the operation and performance of the approach in simulations with multiple tasks that require swarm splitting or merging. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2023; Conference date: 29 May 2023 through 2 June 2023; Conference code: 190430; CODEN: PIIAE</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168686125&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICRA48891.2023.10160335&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c7c85ba1b3fa3d4a97388d561e373caf</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc IEEE Int Conf Rob Autom</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hussein, S.</author><author>Thasin, A.</author><author>Sami, A.</author><author>Sabitha Banu, A.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Gupta D.</author><author>Khanna A.</author><author>Bhattacharyya S.</author><author>Hassanien A.E.</author><author>Anand S.</author><author>Jaiswal A.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Secure AI-Based Flying Ad Hoc Networks: Trusted Communication</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lect.

First, the node structure and deployment application of WSNs are analyzed, and the architecture of UAV collaborative data collection is designed. Second, the related models of communication energy consumption between WSNs' network and UAV cluster, UAV cluster task allocation, and path planning are established successively. Then, a simple but efficient task planning strategy considering UAV forward and return distances is proposed. Finally, for the problem of model solving, the solution strategy of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed. The simulation results verify that the strategy reduces the overall network energy consumption by 42.16% and the total range of UAV by 9.7% and realizes the relative minimization of WSNs energy consumption and UAV flight cost on the premise of ensuring the full coverage of WSNs' nodes.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: H.

However, easy estimation of this key factor by traditional or experimental models is very difficult. This requires comparing available models for achieving the best prediction approach. In this study, four machine learning (ML) methods and two traditional ROP models were utilized to predict ROP. ML techniques include multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR). MLPNN, ANFIS, and RBFNN methods were trained with four meta-heuristic algorithms including particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA). The backpropagation (BP) algorithm was also incorporated to train the ANFIS and MLPNN methods as a conventional method. For comparison purposes, the traditional ROP models of Bourgoyne and Young (BYM) and Bingham were also implemented in combination with four meta-heuristic algorithms. The required data were collected from the mud logging unit (MLU) and the final report of a drilled well located in southwestern of Iran. In the MLU, the information of different sensors is firstly collected through the data communications protocols and sent to a master unit to be processed into relevant dimensions (i.e. create operational variables). In order to accurately record information, the sensors are calibrated at regular intervals. After removing the outliers, the overall noise of data was reduced by Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing filter. Then, in order to simulate a drilling process in a realistic manner and also to evaluate the performance of the models in approximating the penetration rate at greater depth of hole, the available data were divided into 6 sections based on depth. After that, sections 2 to 6 were separately used as a test dataset and all previous sections were considered as a training dataset. Results indicated that PSO-MLPNN achieved the highest performance in comparing with other developed models. The concluding remark is that ML models are more efficient and reliable than traditional models. In addition, combining ML models with meta-heuristic algorithms can achieve better results than conventional algorithms such as BP.

Previous studies have detailed the system trades and physical and control designs that maximize the pointing performance of an MSAC system. As a result, the MSAC system can provide sub-milli-arc-second(mas)/nano-radian level pointing stability and accuracy. Traditional spacecraft design is formulated based on conventional spacecraft bus systems, of which conventional ACSs are a significant driver for the mass and volume of the spacecraft. MSAC relaxes these requirements and enables a new class of spacecraft missions. This paper details the new spacecraft architectures with large area-to-mass ratios that can be enabled using the MSAC system, such as solar sails, Disksats, ChipSats, etc. In addition to standalone spacecraft, MSAC can also be used to provide independent actuation capabilities to different subsystems onboard a spacecraft, such as self-steering antennas, solar panels, and thermal radiators. These new spacecraft busses and subsystems are made possible using MSAC, which can profoundly impact constellation mission development and deployment. Currently, MSAC exists as three main variants for use with different mission types and varying design complexity levels. This paper compares the different variants, and the control authority obtained using the different implementations. In addition to rotational control, MSAC also offers translational position control. These translational positioning capabilities are best at small scales (micrometer-level positioning). The position control can be utilized for internal translational active noise cancellation and formation flying missions that are sensitive to a spacecraft's position. Using the fine pointing and positioning accuracy and stability offered by MSAC can increase communication data rates for deep space optical communication, as well as enable missions such as distributed swarms and LISA. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2023; Conference date: 4 March 2023 through 11 March 2023; Conference code: 188722</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160519267&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO55745.2023.10115834&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a8af09cbcb4f18e6c42684ee6c26df10</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Aerosp.

In particular, to perform various missions with multiple UAVs that are densely gathered and collision free, a hybrid-flocking control algorithm is synthesized by using three types of control protocols: vector field guidance (for path following/loitering), augmented Cucker–Smale (ACS) model (for collective flocking behavior), and potential field (for collision avoidance). In particular, to address the issue of conflicts between different control protocols, the adaptive ACS model is proposed and the optimization problem is formulated to determine the suitable mixing weights of control protocols. We also design the transition of multiple operation modes and communication architecture for the swarm system. The system is evaluated using the proposed hybrid-flocking control algorithm by proof-of-concept real flight experiments using 18 small fixed-wing UAVs as well as extensive numerical simulations. Flight experiments are successfully performed for multiple consecutive tasks including the individual task, circular path loitering and elliptical path loitering while avoiding collisions among UAVs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: H.

It is a big issue that needs to be solved urgently. However, due to the development of infrastructure and technologies in 6G-driven Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), it becomes possible to alleviate urban congestion. Existing solutions either optimize the path planning of each vehicle, or only focus on solving the problem of resource allocation of a single road, neither can take advantage of self-organizing networks and easily fall into local optimum. Combining the above reasons, we propose the Direction Decide as a Service (DDaaS) scheme. First, it contains a novel three-layer service architecture based on Swarm Learning (SL), which enables orderly transmission of traffic data and control instructions and protects user privacy. Second, an improved local model and aggregation method is incorporated into DDaaS, which enables to make accurate predictions when the road resources at a single intersection are insufficient. Third, we propose a dynamic traffic control algorithm to provide signal light switching decisions for rapidly changing ITS. Finally, constructing an urban road simulation experiment combined with SUMO, we prove that DDaaS can reduce traffic congestion effectively and has significant advantages compared to other schemes.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: J.

The heterogeneous collaboration between UAS swarm enhances the complexity and the efficiency of mission complement that requires robustness, flexibility, and sustainability of throughput in UAS swarm networking. The conventional approaches mainly are based on the hierarchical architectures that are limited to satisfy the challenges of UAS swarm with high dynamics on a large scale. In this paper, we propose an optimal cell wall paradigm to enhance the throughput in heterogeneous UAS swarm networking. With the weight adjustment of each link, we map the optimization into a polyhedron scheduling problem and formula the problem into Max-min Throughput Fair Scheduling (MTFS). Further, we propose a max-min throughput algorithm to optimize the minimum throughput of cell wall paradigm. With the optimal max-min throughput, we optimize the schedule with edge-coloring to achieve global MTFS solving. The normalized MTFS shows our algorithm can achieve over 40% improvement of MTFS globally. In terms of MTFS solving, our algorithms have promising potential to improve the throughput and mitigate the incidents for multiple beams enabling of UAS in cell wall communication. With the throughput enhancement, the advanced aerial mobility of UAS swarm networking can be escalated on a large scale. © 2000-2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: H.

Advances in distributed systems, miniaturization and commoditization of space electronics and innovations in communications permit us to rethink the current paradigm of relying on a few heavy, slow and expensive high-tech rovers for Mars surface exploration. In this work, we address the demanding communication needs for a mission that deploys a swarm of uncontrolled wind-driven exploration rovers onto the martian surface. The concept for these lightweight, autonomous, ellipsoid”Tumbleweed” rovers - named after the desert plant - is not new, and was studied and validated by NASA researchers decades ago. Recently, a new plan to turn the Tumbleweed mission into reality has been proposed to the ESA open space innovation platform (OSIP). The idea is to launch approximately 90 Tumbleweeds in one transfer vehicle and release them on the martian surface to survey the northern hemisphere of Mars over a mission duration of three months. Reliable communication is one of the key challenges for this mission. The rovers' instruments, e.g. cameras, generate large volumes of data, and many rovers need to be served simultaneously. Furthermore, the tumbling motion on the martian surface constitutes unprecedented challenges in terms of antenna pointing for planetary exploration rovers. We present a trade-off analysis between direct to Earth communication and relayed communication using satellites orbiting Mars culminating in a baseline communication architecture for the Tumbleweed mission. For this purpose we model the kinematics of the Tumbleweed rovers and relay satellites w.r.t the Earth. A numerical simulation of all potential communication links over the full mission duration is conducted. The analysis shows that direct communication to Earth is infeasible due to the rolling motion of the rover. Hence, the relayed communication scenario is proposed, as it does not require a directional antenna on the Tumbleweed rovers. Therefore, we propose a constellation of three relay satellites in a circular, Earth-facing orbital plane around Mars, which communicate with the Tumbleweed rovers using the UHF frequency band. Commercial ground stations on Earth in Ka-band are used for the relay-ground link. The proposed communications architecture is estimated to achieve a raw data throughput of ě84Mbit per Tumbleweed rover per Sol. Copyright © 2022 by Mr. Felix Abel.

Precursor missions have frequently been used as both technological testbeds and implementers of prerequisite infrastructure to support future missions as part of an incremental space exploration strategy. While Mars presents a new opportunity for human exploration and long-term missions, it also presents new logistical challenges in mission planning and execution. This is due to environmental, communications, and resource availability challenges not experienced with manned missions within the Earth system. Consequently, missions designed for exploration and scouting of areas of interest before the arrival of humans become a necessity. This paper presents a vehicle design and mission architecture for a rapid, cost-efficient, and redundant scout system for high-fidelity mapping and exploration of mission areas. A swarm robotics approach utilizing highly modular, simplified rover platforms and existing commercially available equipment are able to autonomously build 3D maps of large swaths of terrain that include information on topology, mineral concentrations, ambient conditions, and additional data pertinent to mission planning and in-situ resource utilization. Standardized buses with plug-and-play payload racks allow for use of variable payloads to suit mission needs without changes to overall design or logistics. This modular, redundant design represents a considerably valuable mechanism for increasing cost-efficiency and chance of mission-success of interplanetary operations from early-planning to end of mission life.

The “Ten-der” is equipped to flexibly and economically monitor and manage multiple diverse UAVs over otherwise inaccessible terrain through wireless communication. The proposed architecture enables operations and analysis supported by the means to de-tect, assess, and accommodate change and hazards on the spot with effective human observation and coordination. Further, this paper seeks to find the optimal trajectories for UAVs to collect data from sensors in a predefined continuous space. We formulate the path-planning problem for a cooperative, and a diverse swarm of UAVs tasked with optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously with the goal of maximizing accumulated data within a given flight time within cloud data processing constraints as well as minimizing the probable imposed risk during UAVs mission. The risk assessment model determines risk indicators using an integrated Specific Operation Risk Assessment —Bayesian belief network approach, while its resultant analysis is weighted through the analytic hierarchy process ranking model. To this end, as the problem is formulated as a convex optimization model, and we propose a low complexity multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm with a provable performance guarantee to solve the problem efficiently. We show that the MORL architecture can be successfully trained and allows each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action to make optimal movement decisions.

Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 27; Correspondence Address: Y.

Multi-drone missions based on the existing ROS-based communication architecture heavily depend on the master node, and communication delay between nodes might not be sufficient for efficient inter-agent collision avoidance. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid ROS-ROS2 communication architecture for centralised traffic management with the provision of distributed communication for collision avoidance and conflict resolution at intersections. The base station server responsible for traffic management runs on a ROS2 environment, ROS is used for communication with each onboard autopilot, and an intermediate add-on-module interfaces ROS and ROS2 messages. The content of the communication packets between the different nodes is decided based on the design requirements. Overall communication architecture is validated through simulation and hardware experiments.  © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

The toolbox provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to simulate and run experiments on teams of cooperating Crazyflie nano-quadrotors. Specifically, it allows users to perform realistic simulations over robotic simulators as, e.g., Webots and includes bindings of the firmware control and planning functions. The toolbox also provides libraries to perform radio communication with Crazyflie directly inside ROS 2 scripts. The package can be thus used to design, implement and test planning strategies and control schemes for a Crazyflie nano-quadrotor. Moreover, the modular structure of CrazyChoir allows users to easily implement online distributed optimization and control schemes over multiple quadrotors.

This paper examines the Multi-hop Routing with Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (MR-LEACH) to improve the inter-connectivity in the QRDPSO. The MR-LEACH identifies partitions in the network into multi-hop network paths. The multi-hop network paths allow all robots to exchange information without unnecessarily restricting the swarm’s range explicitly. As a result, the QRDPSO with MR-LEACH shows seamless inter-connectivity among the robots, lowering power consumption and increasing robots’ lifetime. Interestingly, this paper also shows that the QRDPSO can reach a faster optimal solution when adopting other communication protocols such as the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) communication schema.

However, the fast mobility and highly dynamic network topology pose unique challenges and require the development of novel multi-hop routing protocols. Previous work in this direction extends geographical protocols, or adapts approaches designed for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), rarely taking full advantage of UAV capabilities. In this paper we introduce a novel data offloading approach, namely Stop &amp; Route, that exploits the device controllable mobility to facilitate network routing. The swarm of UAVs performs data offloading synchronously and recurrently. At fixed intervals of time, the swarm interrupts the sensing mission (stop) and moves, as less as possible, to build a connected formation to the base station and offload the data (route). We provide both centralized solutions - assuming a long-range control channel - and a distributed solution - working in the absence of a control channel. By means of extensive simulations we show that our proposals outperform state-of-the-art solutions, decreasing the time taken to build a connected formation of about 25% and increasing the time spent on sensing of 14%.  © 2023 IFIP.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: N.

While the multi-UAV systems have a great potential in many different scenarios, increasing complexity of missions gave raise to a new set of problems. Some of them include high workload periods of a single operator supervising multiple agents, loss of the situation awareness, increased amount of the data generated by the system and problems in communication channels between the operator and UAVs. All of them could lead to performance degradation in the mission execution or even critical failures of system elements. In general, there are two aspects that help to avoid or at least to decrease mentioned problems - mission planning and human-machine interface (HMI) design. In this paper, we mainly address the mission planning aspect and only briefly present an HMI design that allows simultaneous handling of three UAVs in civil infrastructure data acquisition missions. The proposed interface, among the standard telemetry data, includes data download/upload from/to external services, a trajectory planner and the acquired data representation. The proposed architecture has been tested in a simulation and in a real environment.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2021; Conference date: 15 June 2021 through 18 June 2021; Conference code: 170495</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111440512&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICUAS51884.2021.9476735&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=69f5d2cda3fec3172858c058ee8795a3</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Int.

The purpose of UAV navigation planning is to plan reasonable trajectories for UAVs to avoid obstacles and reach the task area. Essentially, it is a complex optimization problem that requires the use of navigation planning algorithms to search for path-point solutions that meet the requirements under the guide of objective functions and constraints. At present, there are autonomous navigation modes of UAVs relying on airborne sensors and navigation control modes of UAVs relying on ground control stations (GCSs). However, due to the limitation of airborne processor computing power, and background command and control communication delay, a navigation planning method that takes into account accuracy and timeliness is needed. First, the navigation planning architecture of UAVs of end-cloud collaboration was designed. Then, the background cloud navigation planning algorithm of UAVs was designed based on the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). Next, the navigation control algorithm of the UAV terminals was designed based on the multi-objective hybrid swarm intelligent optimization algorithm. Finally, the computer simulation and actual indoor-environment flight test based on small rotor UAVs were designed and conducted. The results showed that the proposed method is correct and feasible, and can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of navigation planning of UAVs. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.

This paper addresses the networking aspect and in particular the routing in such an ad hoc network during surface exploration. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) developed a wireless communication, localization, and timing system including a PHY and MAC for decentralized swarm communication. A decentralized routing protocol is required to realize multi-hop communication. Thus, the natural choice is an ad hoc network routing protocol. We introduce a simulation environment to study ad hoc network routing protocols for this application field. The network simulation provides a TDMA based MAC resembling DLR's system, an IEEE 802.11g MAC, and incorporates elevation data of the Moon's surface for realistic radio propagation modeling.

Considering communication is limited in both bandwidth and range in the real world, we propose a lightweight environment presentation method and an efficient cooperative exploration strategy. For lower bandwidth, each robot uses specific polytopes to maintain free space and to generate Super Frontier Information (SFI), which serves as the source for exploration decision-making. To reduce repeated exploration, we develop a mission-based protocol that drives robots to share collected information in stable rendezvous. We also design a complete path planning scheme for both centralized and decentralized cases. To validate that our framework is practical and generic, we present an extensive benchmark and deploy our system into multi-UGV and multi-UAV platforms. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: F.

Orchestrating these systems towards a successful mission, especially in contested environments, requires strict synchronization and reliable communication among network entities. Although using a ground controller with a long range link provides a cost-effective solution, it is extremely vulnerable to single-point of failure and/or jamming attacks. Thus, in contested environments, adapting ad-hoc policies is one of the most promising approaches, mitigating these vulnerabilities. However, existing ad-hoc approaches fail to sustain multi-hop connections, suffering from frequent topology changes and intermittent links due to dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose self-organizing TDMA (STDMA) protocol for aerial swarms in order to ensure reliable communication through efficient network management. We also partially implement our protocol on a small-scale test-bed and show that how drones are able to self-configure upon joining the network without any prior information. Our proposed STDMA protocol improves the overall channel utilization up to 55 percent with less control traffic overhead compared to the existing studies.  © 2022 ACM.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: E.E.

Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.  © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 55; Correspondence Address: L.T.

As technology continues to evolve, disruption has only continued to increase in size as it finds its place in a wide and diverse field covering both military and domestic fields. With indigenous practices such as search and rescue missions during disasters, environmental monitoring and surveillance, agriculture and farming, this disruption has shifted to a specialized technology, swarm UAVs. Communication is a critical component in swarm systems with the potential to distribute missions and coordinate the operation of many UAVs without operator intervention. In this study, a swarm architecture is proposed that will allow higher swarm autonomy and reliability by providing both reliable communication between swarm systems and the ground station, and communication between individual UAVs. The development of swarm UAVs with autonomous coordination capability with wireless ad hoc networks, an attractive solution for inter-UAV communication, is at the heart of improving the utility of UAV swarms. During the realization of this, the integrated communication architecture of the swarm UAVs, which combines both the long-range architectures offered by 900 MHz-based radios and the short-range architectures offered by 802.11-based ad-hoc networks, coexists. All these systems are implemented using the robot operating system (ROS), which allows it to be easily integrated into the capabilities of any distributed application.  © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 10th International Conference on Recent Advances in Air and Space Technologies, RAST 2023; Conference date: 7 June 2023 through 9 June 2023; Conference code: 191477</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168421655&amp;doi=10.1109%2fRAST57548.2023.10197953&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c2a2c2028926473e69dccb075a5917d6</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc.

Aiming at solving low computational efficiency and poor scalability of the traditional multi-UAV path planning method, the decentralized multi-UAV path planning method suitable for obstacle environments is proposed. Firstly, the UAV rendezvous path planning problem with constraints such as the kinematics of UAVs and collision-free constraints is modeled as a non-convex optimal control problem. To minimize formation rendezvous time and energy consumption, a two-layer coordinative framework is developed to solve this problem. In the coordination layer, relying only on the information of neighboring UAVs, each UAV in the decentralized communication graph negotiates the desired flight time using a consensus protocol to achieve coordination among UAVs. In the planning layer, the initial non-convex formation rendezvous path planning problem is decoupled into several sub-problems, which can be solved in parallel by path planners distributed on each UAV using sequential convex programming. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results show that this decentralized multi-UAV path planning method can handle the minimum-time rendezvous path planning problem and optimize the energy consumption in flight, and the computing time does not increase significantly with the enlargement of the UAV swarm. This decentralized framework scales well with the number of UAVs and can be applied for future urban flight and supplies delivery tasks.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: Z.

The individual UAV, which will form the swarm and serve in this context, is designed in accordance with the swarm behaviors and requirements such as autonomous behavior, formation and coordination. Within the scope of the planned flight missions, the necessary communication architectures were emphasized by considering the communication between the ground control station and other swarm members. The most cost-effective equipment for fundamental tasks such as flight control, swarm intercommunication, object detection has been studied, and individual swarm members are equipped in line with these requirements and limitations. The problem of consistent sharing of data obtained during the flight mission has been examined in detail and appropriate solutions have been produced with proper communication and data transfer protocols. A low-cost solution has been obtained for aerial surveillance applications of the swarm UAV system, which can provide direct point-to-point communication through selected equipment and network message transmission during flight. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

Sensed observations are to be delivered to an earth station either directly or through geo-stationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite relays with minimal delay. A cognitive cooperative data scheduling (CCDS) protocol is proposed for spacecrafts to leverage node cooperation and deep learning predictions to fully utilize available link capacities in order to minimize data delivery delay. Either periodically, or on an event-driven basis, each satellite predicts its expected sensing data payload and the link capacities to both Earth and GEO stations. Each spacecraft implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) that continuously learns from observed data to predict the amount of expected data over the scheduling horizon. Nodes with extra link capacity than anticipated data, called the relay nodes, broadcast their availability to act as relays to those with more expected data than their link capacities (called the source nodes). Based on neighbor requests, each relay node computes a data acceptance schedule to minimize the overall data delivery delay of the swarm. During the execution phase, source nodes forward their data to the relay nodes over the satellite crosslinks who then forward their payloads to the desired destination. Performance evaluations on a simulated system based on low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite clusters show the promise of the proposed cognitive cooperative data scheduling protocol to significantly reduce the overall data delivery delay of the swarm and to improve utilization of available link capacities. This CCDS protocol can easily be adapted for swarms of small spacecrafts deployed to the Moon, Mars, near-Earth objects (NEOs), and other distant locations for remote sensing missions.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2021; Conference date: 21 June 2021 through 23 June 2021; Conference code: 171613</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115867038&amp;doi=10.1109%2fCCAAW50069.2021.9527293&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f202f7902eb065819e54bf64bd8a4ecd</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Cogn.

Under a NASA funded Lunar Sequential project titled 'Efficient and Secure Communications for Spacecraft Beyond LEO,' Antara has been developing modular SpaceVNX+ based small spacecraft and a software package for secure, efficient, and scalable Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) communications for distributed platforms. The paper describes the SpaceVNX+ standard and the CubeSat platform that will host the soft-ware; the LunaNet compatible DTN software, taraION; and the planned Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mission to flight qualify the hardware and software. The LEO mission will be comprised of a small swarm of six SpaceVNX+ CubeSats that will demonstrate secure DTN and autonomous communications between ground stations and CubeSats as well as among the CubeSats. As a case study, the paper also covers the details and analysis of benchtop testing of the mission software and hardware. These emerging capabilities have the potential to make possible new mission architectures, enhance conventional missions and reduce development and deployment timelines, which will enable NASA and other space mission operators to achieve their objectives at significantly lower programmatic risk and cost than traditional approaches. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2023; Conference date: 4 March 2023 through 11 March 2023; Conference code: 188722</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160569799&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO55745.2023.10115701&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=62867d6b37d2e967022811c862508e0e</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Aerosp.

The dynamic task assignment model for the UAV swarm with the topology of distributed subsets is established considering multiple constraints such as task cooperation, performing sequence, dynamic environment, communication topology, payload model, and UAV capability. According to the characteristics of multi-participants and multi-tasks in the process of UAV swarm executing tasks, the determination mechanism on cooperators and the selection mechanism of sequential tasks are proposed, and then the contract network protocol is extended. On the basis of the above, an event-triggered task assignment strategy for dynamic tasks is designed. The simulated results show that the proposed method can achieve the cooperative dynamic assignment of the UAV swarm to perform reconnaissance-and-attack tasks to multi-targets in complex and uncertain combat scenarios, improve the adaptiveness of the swarm under the sudden circumstance, and realize the optimization for task execution efficiency of the UAV swarm. © 2022 by the authors.

These systems are hard to design and reason about, mainly because we desire a particular class of behaviors to emerge from the interplay of heterogeneous individual agents. Nevertheless, mission-critical operations like manufacturing process orchestration in factories use such systems due to their uncompromising availability and resilience of computing services. This paper presents a set of TypeScript libraries to model peer-to-peer workflows as state machines, execute them using the Actyx middleware, and check the shape of these machines for conformance to a swarm protocol. The swarm protocol describes an idealized global view of the cooperation of machines of different roles. It directly corresponds to a diagram a product manager would sketch on a whiteboard; this allows for verifying that the coded state machines correctly implement the product specification. A well-formed swarm protocol also guarantees that conforming machines will achieve eventual consensus on the overall state progression even in the absence of further coordination. This tool is for developers of business logic for heterogeneous swarm systems, helping them verify that their protocols and implementations are correct.

However, science instruments typically cannot be operated simultaneously due to the instrument requirements including optimal viewing angle, surface illumination, altitude and ground resolution, power, and data constraints. This observation has motivated interest in multi-spacecraft architectures where a swarm of small spacecraft, each carrying a single science instrument, studies a small body after being deployed by a carrier spacecraft, which then collects data from the swarm and relays it to Earth. Such architectures hold promise to yield significant improvements in mission efficiency, increases in data quality, and reduced mission duration. A key difficulty in the design of such missions is the selection of orbits for the small spacecraft, which must satisfy not only instrument requirements, but also strict inter-spacecraft communication and on-board storage constraints. To address this, in this paper, we present a novel computationally-efficient optimization algorithm for communication-aware design of the orbits of a small-spacecraft swarm orbiting a small body. The proposed approach captures constraints including instrument requirements, inter-spacecraft communication bandwidths, and on-board memory usage, and it can accommodate highly irregular gravity field models and surface geometries. We propose an efficient algorithm for optimization of instrument observations and inter-spacecraft communications; we then leverage the differentiable nature of the proposed algorithm to accelerate a gradient-based global search algorithm. Numerical simulations of a six-spacecraft swarm studying 433 Eros show that the proposed approach successfully identifies high-quality orbits, and significantly outperforms communication-agnostic optimization techniques, resulting in a 10% increase in scientific returns and a 30% increase in the quality of the collected data. © 2021, Univelt Inc.

Robot interactions may occur at run-time based on the dynamic network topology and on mission-specific goals. For this reason, service discovery mechanisms are fundamental in order to inform each robot about the functionalities offered by the other peers. Although several network discovery protocols have been proposed so far, none of them fits the unique characteristics of robotic swarms in terms of dynamic topology, communication heterogeneity, and latency requirements. In this paper, we fill such gap by designing, implementing and evaluating a novel service discovery mechanisms for generic Robotic Systems-of-Systems (RSoS). The study proposes algorithmic and practical contributions. Regarding the first, we describe a novel distributed service discovery algorithm for RSoS which adapts to highly mobile robotic environments while limiting the network overhead and latency. Regarding the latter, we implemented the proposed algorithm within the Uhura swarm robotics framework; as a result, our solution is able to support multi-radio scenarios where robots are provided with heterogeneous Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication technologies. In addition, we validate our solution through large-scale simulations and a test-bed in which ground robots are able to discover a Federated Learning (FL) task and join it at run-time to improve the accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

Then the Petri net of time factor is introduced to formalize the agent, and the multi-agent simulation framework is constructed based on the task evolution rules of the system. According to the self-organization and self-adaptive characteristics of the swarm, the random walk rules of communication information are proposed to evaluate the RMS of the dynamic system quantitatively. Through the simulation, the model can illustrate the critical impact of the RMS of the UAV swarm on the operational mission to provide technical solutions and theoretical guidance for the system construction and operational application evaluation. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 12th International Conference on Quality, Reliability, Risk, Maintenance, and Safety Engineering, QR2MSE 2022; Conference date: 27 July 2022 through 30 July 2022; Conference code: 189505</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164297770&amp;doi=10.1049%2ficp.2022.3152&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8b5fcb3304ec163b06c0c20b262d2dad</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IET.

However, the limitation of AUVs' battery cannot support persistent services, which restricts AUVs' operating range and mission duration. In this paper, a mobile underwater charging solution is developed that can continuously recharge a swarm of AUVs by using a wireless mobile charger. Magnetic induction-based communication and wireless energy transfer are employed. This paper first shows that by using tri-axis coils, reliable wireless communication and wireless energy transfer without coil orientation losses can be obtained. After that, wireless communication, motion control, and wireless energy transfer are jointly designed for a swarm of mission-driven AUVs. In particular, optimal continuous motion controllers are developed for AUVs to avoid intra-swarm collisions and networking protocols are designed to optimally allocate resources for wireless communication and wireless energy transfer. The proposed approach can guide AUVs to their destinations, while maintaining wireless network integrity and maximizing wireless energy transfer efficiency, upon which the constraints on AUVs' batteries can be eliminated and cheaper and smaller AUVs can be employed for various underwater applications.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: H.

The proposed hybrid framework 'Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration Aquila Optimizer' (CME-AO) is a unique combination of both deterministic Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration (CME) and a swarm based methodology, known as Aquila Optimizer (AO). A novel parallel communication protocol is also embedded to improve multi-robot space exploration process while simultaneously minimizing both the computation complexity and time. This ensures acquisition of a optimal collision-free path in a barrier-filled environment via generating a finite map. The architecture starts by determining the cost and utility values of neighbouring cells around the robot using deterministic CME. Aquila Optimization technique is then incorporated to increase the overall solution accuracy. Numerous simulations under different environmental conditions were then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Algorithm consistency aspects in achieving the expected results (area explored rate and time) is demonstrated through statistical means. A perspective analysis is then performed by comparing the performance of the CME-AO algorithm with latest state of art contemporary algorithms namely conventional CME and CME-WO (CME Whale Optimizer). The comparison duly accommodates all pertinent aspects such as % area explored, number of failed runs, and time taken for map exploration for different environments. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents two distinct advantages over the other conventional state of the art CME based techniques a) enhanced map exploration in cluttered environment and b) significantly reduced computation complexity and execution time, with almost no fail runs. This makes the suggested methodology particularly suitable for on-board utilization in an obstacle-cluttered environment, where other techniques either fails (stuck locally) or takes longer exploration time.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: I.

However, many dynamic events can cause a partial failure of the original mission during the mission execution process, in which case task reassignment should be carried out. How to reassign resources and tasks in multi-dynamic, multi-target, and multi-constraint events becomes a core issue in the enhancement of combat efficiency. This paper establishes a model of multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance task reassignment that comprehensively considers various dynamic factors such as UAV performance differences, size of target areas, and time window constraints. Then, a two-stage distributed task assignment algorithm (TS-DTA) is presented to achieve multi-task reassignment in dynamic environments. Finally, this paper verifies the effectiveness of the TS-DTA algorithm through simulation experiments and analyzes its performance through comparative experiments. The experimental results show that the TS-DTA algorithm can efficiently solve the task reassignment problem in dynamic environments while effectively reducing the communication burden of UAV formations. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: X.

The precise positioning of subsea cables is an important prerequisite for maintenance and repair. However, the small diameter and burial depth of 3–5 m below the seabed make locating and detecting the subsea cable technically challenging. This paper investigates the localization and intelligent tracking detection of subsea cables based on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. First, an autonomous electromagnetic localization and tracking topology of subsea cable is designed based on AUV architecture and PSO algorithm. The basic principle of locating the horizontal position and depth of a subsea cable based on horizontal survey line measurement is illustrated. Second, the PSO algorithm is retrofitted with electromagnetic localization. Specifically, the subsea cable localization flow diagram, region of interest (ROI) and fitness function are constructed, respectively. Third, an online swath path planning method for subsea cable detection is designed based on the PSO localization results. Finally, the effectiveness of the PSO submarine cable location algorithm and the online planning method for detection paths is verified through multiple controlled simulation tests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: X.

These are especially helpful in situations in which human lives are at risk. OGI pipelines are threatened by natural and man-made disasters, which are harmful to both people and assets. Usually, oil and gas pipelines pass through extreme environments for which standard inspection, maintenance, and repairing approaches such as rope access, scaffolds, telescopic elevation platforms supported by cranes, and manned helicopters are not secure and difficult and expensive to implement. However, technological advancements like device miniaturization have boosted the performance of UAVs, offering cost-effective, efficient, and high mission flexibility. UAVs are capable of carrying sensors and cameras to perform monitoring. As pipelines span thousands of kilometers, multi-UAV systems, commonly referred to as flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs), can collaboratively complete monitoring missions more effectively and economically as compared with single UAV systems. Moreover, many issues must be resolved before the effective use of UAVs can provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Several OGI-specific issues of UAVs such as architecture design, platform, sensors, networking architectures, and path planning models for different OGI pipeline surveillance scenarios must be resolved to use FANETs effectively for robust and sustainable networks. The prime objective of this research is a state-of-the-art review of UAVs in OGI. We first present OGI midstream challenges and parameters to give a brief overview of the challenges faced by the OGI for pipeline surveillance. Then we discuss OGI-specific scenarios for sensor readings, visual leak detection, and detection of any unusual activity that happens in the pipeline while monitoring through UAVs. We also present different OGI-specific UAV platforms, UAV networking architectures, and path planning models of FANET for efficient communication and collaboration. Finally, the challenges of UAVs and future research prospects in OGI-specific UAVs are highlighted.  © 2022 SPIE and IS&amp;T.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: K.

However, instruments often cannot be operated simultaneously due to requirements including viewing angle, illumination, power, and data constraints. This has motivated interest in architectures in which a swarm of small spacecraft, each carrying one instrument, studies a small body after being deployed by a carrier spacecraft; such architectures hold promise to yield significant improvements in mission efficiency, increased data quality, and reduced mission duration. A key difficulty is the selection of orbits for the spacecraft, which must satisfy not only instrument requirements but also communication and data storage constraints. To address this, we propose a novel gradient-based optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimizes spacecraft orbits, observations, and communications; the approach captures instrument requirements, communication bandwidth, and memory usage, and it accommodates irregular gravity field models and surface geometries. Numerical simulations of a six-spacecraft swarm studying the 433 Eros asteroid show that the approach results in a 67.9% increase in data returned as compared to a communication-agnostic approach. Collectively, these results enable system designers to quickly assess the end-to-end performance of multispacecraft constellations, and represent a first step toward communication-aware design of multispacecraft missions for small Solar System body exploration. © 2022 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; CODEN: JGCOD</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141157809&amp;doi=10.2514%2f1.G006515&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5dbd7eeff177c688d958f47d781f0498</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheriguene, Y.</author><author>Bousbaa, F.Z.</author><author>Kerrache, C.A.</author><author>Djellikh, S.</author><author>Lagraa, N.</author><author>Lahby, M.</author><author>Lakas, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COCOMA: a resource-optimized cooperative UAVs communication protocol for surveillance and monitoring applications</title><secondary-title>Wireless Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wireless Networks</full-title><abbr-1>Wireless Networks</abbr-1></periodical><keywords><keyword>Aerial vehicle</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword><keyword>Energy efficiency</keyword><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Surveillance applications</keyword><keyword>Fault tolerance</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm</keyword><keyword>Energy</keyword><keyword>Energy effciency</keyword><keyword>Green UAV networking</keyword><keyword>Green unmanned aerial vehicle networking</keyword><keyword>Internet protocols</keyword><keyword>Monitoring applications</keyword><keyword>Multicast routing</keyword><keyword>Multicasting</keyword><keyword>Network topology</keyword><keyword>Power management (telecommunication)</keyword><keyword>Routing protocols</keyword><keyword>UAV swarms</keyword><keyword>Vehicle networkings</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10220038 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11276-022-03031-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The deployment of a swarm of cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to pursue a mission is knowing an increasing success nowadays. This is mainly because deploying a group of cooperating UAVs instead of one single UAV offers numerous advantages, including the extension of the mission coverage, fault tolerance in case of losing a UAV during a mission, and improving the data gathering accuracy. Multicast routing, on the other hand, is a critical operation for UAV swarm networks, as it facilitates critical tasks including information transmission and swarm coordination. Moreover, designing efficient multicast protocols with Quality of Service (QoS) can be challenging due to various factors such as limited energy constraints and the dynamically changing topology with 3D movement which causes frequent changes in the network topology. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the multicast routing problem in a swarm of UAVs. We first provide a detailed classification of existing efforts in swarm routing protocols in terms of transmission strategies. And second, we propose a new Energy Efficient Inter-UAV Multicast Routing Protocol for surveillance and monitoring applications called “COCOMA”. We illustrate through extensive simulations that COCOMA achieves the desired efficient communication backbone and Quality-of-Service. We also discuss and implement an improvement of COCOMA called COCOMA+ and show that both versions are efficient and effective in term of reducing the total emission energy by at least 10 dBm compared to the state-of-art work SP-GMRF. In addition, our proposal optimizes also the End-to-End Delay, the number of hops in the routing process, and the network throughput which consequently leads to increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.A.

Resilience of traditional monolithic spacecraft is achieved mainly through redundancy, which exponentially increases the complexity of their production, and therefore, their cost. One solution would be to use fragmented spacecraft systems. Redundancy is achieved by nature with local complexity. Furthermore, scalability of such a system is facilitated. However, data transfer and physical communication link between the 'fragments' must be addressed. The main challenge of these systems is the management of the network of satellites. Traditional centralised networks, managed by a single entity, have been proven not to be secure, as they generate a common point of failure, susceptible to attacks. Traditional distributed networks, managed by multiple entities, require honest participants and trust between entities, restricting collaborative mission applications. In the present article, a design for a blockchain-enabled swarm fractionated system managed by multiple trustless entities is proposed. The system is composed of functionally different nano-satellites which perform tasks from different subsystems in order to replicate the functionalities of a monolithic spacecraft. The blockchain nodes are deployed in the satellites and allow sharing of sensor data between the network. A consensus protocol ensures the validity of the shared data. The proposed system has been implemented and evaluated on a local blockchain composed of four Ethereum nodes. We believe that the proposed application opens the way to new collaborative missions between entirely trustless parties, ensuring transparency and cooperation within the system. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2022; Conference date: 5 March 2022 through 12 March 2022; Conference code: 181782</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137589532&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO53065.2022.9843336&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=da2cfc9293dfc3ae482a2ae7a9c95eb5</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Aerosp.

They exhibit robustness and fault tolerance when facing complex missions, making it crucial in military, transportation, intelligent traffic, and other fields. However, the coupling between the hardware and software of a heterogeneous unmanned swarm can indeed have significant implications for system flexibility, software development and deployment, and hardware maintenance. Over the years, there has been a significant shift from traditional hardware-focused control systems to a greater emphasis on the core software layer. In this paper, a distributed network architecture is proposed to solve this problem, in which hardware resources are abstracted and represented to accomplish standardization and unification by defining a consistent and uniform set of data formats, and a resource pool of hardware data is constructed to realize the function that the number and scale of platforms is irrelevant, the task module can be plug-and-play at any time, and the software can be configured on demand. The resource scheduling of a single platform is achieved through process and thread communication using shared memory, while the resource scheduling of a cross platform is achieved through a network using request and response and subscription and notification. As a result, it can satisfy the development of functional modules in a software-defined mode and gradually improve the intelligence capability of an unmanned swarm. Based on the above architecture, the overall framework of the autonomous navigation system and the collaborative control system has been successfully established. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment is constructed, and the integration and verification of the proposed distributed architecture is carried out by the cooperative formation experiment, which proves the feasibility of this proposal. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Z.

The focus of this research is on the ad-hoc scalability of SoS, meaning that the size of the system can change during operation by adding or removing a CS or changing the size of existing CSs. The Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) is selected as a practical example to showcase the challenge and solution of ad-hoc scalability. UVF has various applications in fields such as search and rescue, intelligent transportation and mobility, but it operates in a dynamic environment that is prone to uncertainties like changing missions, increasing range and capacity, UV failures, and battery requirements. The proposed solution to overcome these uncertainties is a self-adaptive system that can dynamically change the UVF architecture in real-time, allowing for upscaling or downscaling the size of the UVF. The Mission Control Center (MCC) can control this change either through fully-automatic mode based on performance criteria like battery utilization and communication traffic, or through manual mode where the operator makes the decision. A multi-agent environment and rule management engine are implemented to simulate the UVF behavior and validate the proposed solution in both automatic and manual modes. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Real-time updates including positions of neighboring nodes is performed when, for example, autonomous vehicles execute a cooperative maneuver, industrial robots collaborate with each other on a task, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) execute a mission in a swarm. For the design of networked automatic control strategies in these scenarios, it is essential to understand the performance of such Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications from the information freshness perspective. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework which allows characterizing the Age of Information (AoI) in networks governed by the Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol. Differently from existing work, we take into account the fact that update packets sent by mobile nodes are not necessarily periodic, since packet triggering is often coupled with agents' mobility. Our approach is based on the assumption that diverse mobility-triggered message generation patterns can be modeled by a wide class of update traffic arrival processes. We apply Discrete Markovian Arrival Process (DMAP), which is a versatile arrival model able to fit arrival patterns that are modulated by a finite state machine, including bursty traffic. We develop an accurate and efficient analytical model of nodes exchanging one-hop broadcast update messages with bursty arrivals to evaluate the moments as well as entire probability distribution of several performance metrics, including AoI. An asymptotic analysis for large networks suggests a simple way to control the update message rate to minimize the AoI. We show that the optimal update rate that minimizes the mean AoI coincides with the optimum of the wireless channel utilization. Numerical examples point out that the asymptotic theory provides accurate predictions also for small values of the number of nodes.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: A.

Firstly, the second-order system dynamic model of the UAV is established. Secondly, the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function containing the distance term are defined, and the potential field function between the UAVs considering the influence of communication is designed to realize the control objectives of UAV collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and smoothly reaching the target point. Then, a new consensus control protocol is designed by combining IAPF and consensus theory. UAVs can achieve convergence and consensus of relative distance and speed between the UAVs while maintaining the stability of the formation. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the stability of the system, and simulations are carried out through the formation of four UAVs. The results show that this method can achieve the control objectives of collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and the convergence of position and speed in the formation of trajectory planning. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 40th Chinese Control Conference, CCC 2021; Conference date: 26 July 2021 through 28 July 2021; Conference code: 172297</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117319005&amp;doi=10.23919%2fCCC52363.2021.9550138&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4eab5245d239597bd0edd57a01d0aa3e</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Chinese Control Conf., CCC</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yeniceri, R.</author><author>Saldiran, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design and development of an avionics architecture for autonomous UAV Fleets</title><secondary-title>2021 12th International Conference on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, ICMAE 2021</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Int.

Applications such as signal tracking or dynamic object tracking with multiple UAVs allow a cost-effective and minimum-risk alternative to missions which have been historically handled with manned aircraft. As such, for these specific applications, we have developed a micro-avionics architecture structured around an in-house customized open-source autopilot and an indigenous Linux based single board payload/flight management computer. The essential 5-km range telemetry and control link radio is backed up by high-power long-range IEEE 802.11n (WiFi) radio device. The redundancy of communication not only improves the reliability of the avionics architecture, but also enables the trade-off between bandwidth and power efficiency. The architecture is capable of transmitting data at rates above 200 kbps up to 4 km away from its ground station equipped with the developed miniature patch antenna tracker. The payload/flight management computer is ready to run a CSI/USB connected day-light or low-illumination infra-red camera, a USB connected software defined radio and different types of sensor payloads such as radar/lidar range sensors and RGBD cameras. Tied to this architecture, we have designed a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing system with MAVlink communication protocol interlinking hardware to Matlab based UAV dynamic models and tracking algorithms. This system allows comprehensive simulation and testing of designed control and guidance algorithms before flight tests while minimizing cost and crash risk. We have successfully used the avionics architecture in flight tests that involve (a) system identification of flight vehicles and (b) tracking and identification of signal sources using multiple UAVs.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 12th International Conference on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, ICMAE 2021; Conference date: 16 July 2021 through 19 July 2021; Conference code: 171531</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115364557&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICMAE52228.2021.9522365&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dbb875b00677cfd96259c82e0d2938e1</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Int.

The platform consists of loosely coupled components interacting via message brokers, which we evaluate through a pair of real-life experiments that emulate reference use-cases. We then look into the performance of drone-to-ground communications, with a particular focus on latency. We implement a dedicated, low-resource communications module with efficient serialization protocols and asynchronous message handling, to compare against the built-in message broker approach. Our data shows the importance of low-level prioritization of drone control requests and indicates that message broker approaches may not be suitable for drone swarms. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

This lack of coverage is particularly concentrated in rural and low-income areas, in which the lack of a cost-effective electricity supply is the main barrier to expanding network coverage. To tackle this problem, this work proposes a theoretical model based on a self-sustainable 5G network architecture in which the mission planning of a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is efficiently scheduled to provide cellular coverage over the territory and to reduce the required energy consumption. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming is provided to formalize the problem of minimizing the energy consumption required by the swarm of UAVs that are able to provide coverage by operating at different altitudes. In order to practically solve the problem, a Genetic Algorithm is defined and evaluated over a realistic scenario. Results indicate that a higher granularity in the number of altitudes at which UAVs can provide coverage increases the percentage of territory that is covered, while a small penalty on the energy consumption must be paid compared to the case in which an unique altitude over the ground is considered. © 2021</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: J.

UAV's observation range and communication methods between UAVs have a significant impact on multi-UAV collaboration strategy. For this purpose, we study the multi-UAV observation range dynamic control method and the optimal inter-UAV communication method. Our approach is to design a multi-UAV joint observation, communication, policy, and service collaboration protocol and study the optimization method of the protocol. We propose an expert-guided deep reinforcement learning framework to optimize this protocol. Each UAV's optimal radar observation range and inter-UAV communication method are learned using an information entropy value decomposition method. Through our observation and communication method, multi-UAV are able to obtain the most valuable information. Experiments demonstrate that our method can improve MEC's service coverage by 9.38%-21.88% compared to the classical MARL algorithm. Our method improves the radar observation efficiency and communication efficiency by 3.05%-38.9% and 8.55%-22.03%, respectively. The results show that this method improves multi-UAV energy utilization. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

Since the GCS belongs to the central control architecture, the edge computing system of the distributed architecture can give drones more flexibility in dealing with changing environmental conditions, allowing them to autonomously and instantly plan their flight path, fly in formation, or even avoid obstacles. Broadcast communications are used to realize UAV-to-UAV communications, thus allocating tasks among a swarm of UAVs and ensuring that each individual UAV collaborates as an integrated member of the group. The dynamic path programming problem for UAV swarm missions uses a two-phase tabu search with a 2-Opt exchange method and an A* search as the path programming algorithm. Distance is taken as a cost function for path programming. The turning points of no-fly zones are then increased and expanded based on drone fleet coverage, thus preventing drones from entering prohibited areas. Unlike previous work, which mostly considers only single no-fly zones, this approach accounts for multiple restricted areas, ensuring that a UAV swarm can complete its assigned task without violating no-fly zones. A drone encountering an obstacle while traveling along the route set by the algorithm will update the map information in real time, allowing for instant recharting of the optimal path to the goal as a reverse search using the D* Lite algorithm. © 2022 by the authors.

Aiming at the problem that the traditional combinatorial optimization algorithm needs to set up the global battlefield situation in advance, considering the consumability of resources in the attack process, the integrated search and attack task flow is established. Considering the communication restricted environment, the unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) are grouped, with centralized architecture within the group and distributed structure between the groups, and the corresponding distributed auction mechanism is constructed to achieve OWTA within the communication range limited. In order to solve the problem that it is difficult to ensure the time consistency of the coordinated attack target, a dubins cooperative path planning based on cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm is proposed. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to adjust the radius of the dubins path of each bomb, so that the uav in the same group can hit the target simultaneously without collision and have the shortest flight range. The simulation results show that the designed distributed auction algorithm takes into account the consumption of attack resources, and quickly redistributes the firepower to the new targets in the dynamic uncertain environment, which ensures the maximization of the execution efficiency of the multi-machine cluster fire allocation task.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

One of these AI technologies is using efficient and secure multi-environment Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) for anti-submarine attacks. This study’s contribution is the early detection of a submarine assault employing hybrid environment UVs that are controlled using swarm optimization and secure the information in between UVs using a decentralized cybersecurity strategy. The Dragonfly Algorithm is used for the orientation and clustering of the UVs in the optimization approach, and the Re-fragmentation strategy is used in the Network layer of the TCP/IP protocol as a cybersecurity solution. The research’s noteworthy findings demonstrate UVs’ logistical capability to promptly detect the target and address the problem while securely keeping the drone’s geographical information. The results suggest that detecting the submarine early increases the likelihood of averting a collision. The dragonfly strategy of sensing the position of the submersible and aggregating around it demonstrates the reliability of swarm intelligence in increasing access efficiency. Securing communication between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) improves the level of secrecy necessary for the task. The swarm navigation is based on a peer-to-peer system, which allows each UAV to access information from its peers. This, in turn, helps the UAVs to determine the best route to take and to avoid collisions with other UAVs. The dragonfly strategy also increases the speed of the mission by minimizing the time spent finding the target. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Based on the concept of modularity, the proposed architecture divides the overall system into five layers: 1) low-level control layer; 2) high-level control layer; 3) coordination layer; 4) communication layer; and 5) human interaction layer, and many modules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and outputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can be reduced but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware box.

However, flying several UAVs at once poses many challenges to safely and efficiently localizing and monitoring them. Further, they need to maintain their formation distance to avoid collision between team members and any environmental obstacles. Besides, SUAVs are mainly equipped with an on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to obtain their positions, but they are not accurate enough and suffer from several vulnerabilities that restrict their applications. Thus, in GPS-denied situations, the acquisition of the positions of UAVs can be assisted by alternative technologies and solutions. This paper is one of the foremost in-depth works that present the topic of localization of SUAVs from various perspectives including current research challenges on positioning systems, telecommunication, and path planning, along with future opportunities on automated delivery services such as medicine, remote inspection of industrial sites, and precision agriculture.  © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: I.

This context contributed to the growth of applications based on the use of one or multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Networks composed of multiple UAVs are being used as a matter of improving the effectiveness, accuracy, and minoring the time of missions. However, these applications demand a high rate of data exchange, such as the localization information of each UAV, which can be a challenge, due to the limited transmission power of certain drone platforms. This article proposes a communication service for multi-UAV systems based on dividing the UAV-fleet into groups using the communication protocol IEEE 802.11 ac. Each group has its local network, whose participants can be chosen based on the UAV's localization or task assignment. UAVs/Drones within the same group constantly communicate, exchanging pose information and specific mission-related data. On the other hand, communication between different groups is only established by messenger drones in pre-set times. The communication service from its detailed implementation to its simulated and field validation experiments is presented in this paper. The results of three different network topologies provide evidence that the proposed communication service for multi-UAV is efficient and can be used for drone cooperative missions. © 2023 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: E.

With the growing size of the UAV swarm in complex missions, it becomes a challenge to control them for efficient execution of missions. In a traditional centralized communication model where all UAVs in the swarm are controlled directly through ground control, channel capacity limits the number of UAVs in the swarm which restricts the scalability. In the context of low-power miniature drones, we limit the communication of the ground Base Station (gBS) with only one UAV (leader) which controls the rest of the UAVs (followers). Towards this, we propose a greedy heuristic method for selecting the UAV leader that requires minimal time to communicate with the gBS in real-time. The proposed master-slave model enhances the scalability of the swarm by improving the utilization of channel resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic leader selection enhances the lifetime of the entire network with a multifold decrease in energy consumption, compared to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the lifetime of the network also decreases on operating with a single UAV leader. We also observe reductions in delays by almost 60% and an increase in data rate by 50%. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2021; Conference date: 7 December 2021 through 11 December 2021; Conference code: 176805</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127248715&amp;doi=10.1109%2fGLOBECOM46510.2021.9685538&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=18c3125c0b92241268d75d98c2ada520</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Glob.

The use of a group of UAVs instead of one single UAV offers many advantages like extending the mission coverage, providing a reliable ad-hoc networks services, and enhancing the service performance, to name a few. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of the swarm topology, the coordination of a large number of UAVs poses new challenges to traditional inter-UAV communication protocols. Therefore, there is a need for the design of new networking protocols that can efficiently support the fast-pace and real-time requirements of a coordinated swarm navigation in various environments. In this paper, we propose SEMRP a Swarm energy-efficient multicast routing protocol for UAVs flying in group formations. The main purpose of SEMRP is to facilitate the control and information delivery between UAVs while minimizing inter-UAV packet loss, packet re-transmission, and end-to-end delay. In this study we show how SEMRP achieves these objectives by taking into account various Quality-of-Service parameters like the network throughput, the UAVs mobility, and energy efficiency to ensure a timely and accurate information delivery to all members of a UAV swarm. The results of the conducted simulation using NS-2 advocate for the efficiency of our proposal through its to two presented versions (SEMRP-v1 and SEMRP-v2) in term of reducing the total emission energy (at least by 10 dBm), optimizing the End-to-End Delay by 44%, and increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol.  © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 17; Conference name: 24th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications, DS-RT 2020; Conference date: 14 September 2020 through 16 September 2020; Conference code: 163757</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094813992&amp;doi=10.1109%2fDS-RT50469.2020.9213700&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1b5e43d3a51deece772e60ce0fcdf7f3</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc.

This is due to the robustness and versatility they present to effectively undertake a set of tasks autonomously. One of the essential elements for several vehicles, in this case, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), to perform tasks autonomously and cooperatively is trajectory planning, which is necessary to guarantee the safe and collision-free movement of the different vehicles. This document includes the planning of multiple trajectories for a swarm of UAVs based on 3D Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM). This swarm is capable of reaching different locations of interest in different cases (labeled and unlabeled), supporting of an Emergency Response Team (ERT) in emergencies in urban environments. In addition, an architecture based on Robot Operating System (ROS) is presented to allow the simulation and integration of the methods developed in a UAV swarm. This architecture allows the communications with the MavLink protocol and control via the Pixhawk autopilot, for a quick and easy implementation in real UAVs. The proposed method was validated by experiments simulating building emergences. Finally, the obtained results show that methods based on probability roadmaps create effective solutions in terms of calculation time in the case of scalable systems in different situations along with their integration into a versatile framework such as ROS. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper we combine foraging and building task as a new type task and implement on our swarm robotic system-SociBuilder. The platform is composed of three parts: active region, modules and many robots called Socibots. In order to execute the task automatically and effectively, we propose a new system architecture including three layers: human-computer interaction layer (HCI), planning layer and execution layer. For the same reason, we put forward a novel algorithm to adjust individual behavior dynamically. As a result of our experiments, Socibots use only local information and do not need communication with others in forage, and fewer individuals are centralized control for building task.

This paper presents and evaluates a command architecture for a multi-spacecraft mission. It combines swarm techniques with a decentralized / local decision making architecture (which uses a set of shared blackboards for coordination) and demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. Under this approach, the Blackboard software architecture is used to facilitate data sharing between craft as part of a resilient hierarchy and the swarm techniques are used to coordinate activity. The paper begins with an overview of prior work on the precursor command technologies and then presents five command architectures for comparison purposes. Then, it presents a qualitative analysis of these techniques, followed by a quantitative analysis which characterizes the constellation's performance across a variety of prospective scenarios including normal operations, several mission scenarios which limit communications, operations in an intentionally communications-denied environment and operations across a variety of craft failure scenarios.

These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas. © 1998-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1491</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971556355&amp;doi=10.1109%2fCOMST.2015.2495297&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b590a744882db05fef403c95a2ed3d8f</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buinhas, L.</author><author>Peytaví, G.G.</author><author>Förstner, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Navigation and communication network for the Valles Marineris Explorer (VaMEx)</title><secondary-title>Acta Astronautica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Astronautica</full-title><abbr-1>Acta Astronaut</abbr-1></periodical><pages>280-296</pages><volume>160</volume><keywords><keyword>Navigation</keyword><keyword>Mars</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Robotics</keyword><keyword>Robots</keyword><keyword>Triangulation</keyword><keyword>Hazardous environment</keyword><keyword>Interplanetary spacecraft</keyword><keyword>Planetary exploration</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Geometrical optics</keyword><keyword>Operational architecture</keyword><keyword>GNSS</keyword><keyword>Positioning</keyword><keyword>Geometry constraints</keyword><keyword>Cartographic triangulation</keyword><keyword>Coverage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00945765 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.actaastro.2019.04.032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With recent advances in robotics and space technology for the exploration of our Solar System, innovative mission concepts are being proposed to further extend our knowledge of our neighbouring planets and their satellites. VaMEx, abbreviation for Valles Marineris Explorer, is an example of such an initiative. VaMEx aims to survey the canyons of the Valles Marineris, for the duration of one year. A cluster of robotic elements is tasked with the planetary exploration activities. Due to the hazardous environment, it is required that these elements navigate autonomously, broadcast position information and exchange science data during the operational phase of the mission. To support these functions, a VaMEx space segment composed of one (or more) orbiter satellite(s) is proposed. Three possible swarm localization schemes were investigated: 1) radio positioning, 2) cartographic triangulation of ground features from optical images and 3) cartographic triangulation of radar persistent scatters. For each of the proposed navigation concepts, a suitable orbit constellation solution was assessed. Each solution was evaluated in terms of orbit stability, control effort and communications performance using metrics specific to each of the three concepts (length of pass, visibility gaps, geometry constraints, etc.). With the described navigation concept and mission analysis results, a preliminary operational architecture for the VaMEx space segment is conceived, taking into account existing technologies, communications performance, overall mission complexity and feasibility. © 2019 IAA</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: L.

Under this perspective, enemy forces will seek to disable or disturb our autonomous Things and our complex infrastructures and systems. Autonomy, scale and complexity in our defense systems will trigger new cyber-attack strategies, and autonomous intelligent malware (AIM) will be part of the picture. Should these cyber-attacks succeed while human operators remain unaware or unable to react fast enough due to the speed, scale or complexity of the mission, systems or attacks, missions would fail, our networks and C4ISR would be heavily disrupted, and command and control would be disabled. New cyber-defense doctrines and technologies are therefore required. Autonomous cyber defense (ACyD) is a new field of research and technology driven by the defense sector in anticipation of such threats to future military infrastructures, systems and operations. It will be implemented via swarms of autonomous intelligent cyber-defense agents (AICAs) that will fight AIM within our networks and systems. This paper presents this cyber-defense technology of the future, the current state of the art in this field and its main challenges. First, we review the rationale of the ACyD concept and its associated AICA technology. Then, we present the current research results from NATO's IST-152 Research Task Group on the AICA Reference Architecture. We then develop the 12 main technological challenges that must be resolved in the coming years, besides ethical and political issues. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Conference name: 2019 IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2019; Conference date: 12 November 2019 through 14 November 2019; Conference code: 158374; CODEN: PMICE</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082387176&amp;doi=10.1109%2fMILCOM47813.2019.9021038&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=def016a9db6c23ed9dc8bc7df82cdb24</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cong, P.U.</author><author>Ahmed, I.</author><author>Allen, E.</author><author>Choo, K.-K.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A stochastic packet forwarding algorithm in flying ad hoc networks: Design, analysis, and evaluation</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>162614-162632</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Military applications</keyword><keyword>Military vehicles</keyword><keyword>Ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Ad-hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Routings</keyword><keyword>Stochastic models</keyword><keyword>Stochastic systems</keyword><keyword>Internet-of-drone</keyword><keyword>Stochastics</keyword><keyword>Flying ad hoc network</keyword><keyword>Flying ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Internet-of-Drones</keyword><keyword>Bit error rate</keyword><keyword>Routing-protocol</keyword><keyword>Entropy</keyword><keyword>Packet forwarding</keyword><keyword>Stochastic packet forwarding</keyword><keyword>Telecommunications traffic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>21693536 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3133850</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Over the past decade, unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs; widely known as drones) are quickly being deployed in various civilian as well as military applications. Drones can self-organize into a connected swarm (Flying Ad Hoc Networks – FANETs) to complete various challenging missions. As the primary building block of Internet-of-Drones (IoD), FANETs have an important role to play in governing the autonomous movement of drones and supporting drone-to-everything (D2X) communications. However, factors such as flying characteristics and the highly dynamic topology of FANETs compound the challenges of packet forwarding; thus, the focus of this article. Specifically, a stochastic packet forwarding algorithm (hereafter referred to as SPA) is proposed for FANETs, where the data packets can be efficiently transferred to the destination. In SPA, the packet sender evaluates each next hop forwarding candidate drone based on different network metrics, prior to selecting the next hop forwarding drone according to the forwarding probability. In addition, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of SPA. Then, the link expiration time and link throughput are chosen as network metrics for network simulation experiments, where SPA is evaluated and compared with prior schemes (e.g, DTNgeo and GeoUAVs). The performance of SPA is evaluated in a real-world testbed to complement the network simulation experiments. Findings from the evaluations demonstrate that SPA obtains better performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet delivery latency, the number of delivered data packets, average link lifetime, and bit error rate. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

As a critical component of the aviation swarm, the airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communications capability, enabling information sharing between both manned and unmanned military aircrafts as well as surface and ground platforms. The deficiencies of legacy ATNs, particularly their inability to meet the communications demands of the aviation swarm, motivated us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm to the ATN and to design an SDN-enabled ATN (SD-ATN) for the aviation swarm. For the SDN paradigm, the communications efficiency between the control plane and the data plane directly impacts the normal operations of the network, raising a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN, which is that how to ensure the QoS requirements of the non-elastic information transmitted between the control plane and the data plane (non-elastic C/D information) is met. To address this issue, a transmission framework is first proposed to make it practical to provide dedicated QoS guarantee for the non-elastic C/D information. Then, a communication protocol is designed based on the proposed framework, aiming at transmitting the non-elastic C/D information in a reliable and real-time manner. The simulation results show that, in the aviation environment, our scheme does improve the transmission efficiency of the non-elastic C/D information, which performs better than legacy solutions. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: S.

These UAV-enabled networks can meet several complex mission requirements and are seen as a potential enabler for many of the emerging use-cases in future communication networks. Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and mobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which can cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks are envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their own challenges and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we analyze the key security and resilience issues resulting from the application of wireless mesh networks within UAV swarms. Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of applying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose existing vulnerabilities across the communication stack. Based on this analysis, we present a security-focused architecture for UAV mesh communications. Finally, from the identification of these vulnerabilities, we discuss research opportunities posed by the unique challenges of UAV swarm connectivity. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 13; Conference name: 17th Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems, DCOS 2021; Conference date: 14 July 2021 through 16 July 2021; Conference code: 174301</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123284965&amp;doi=10.1109%2fDCOSS52077.2021.00059&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b9c5fd6ffdfe3d215fd5b68c37fc0d07</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc. - Annu.

However, most existing routing protocols for UAV networks aim at unicast routing, and there are few multicast protocols dedicated to UAV networks. Furthermore, most existing multicast protocols for mobile wireless networks usually maintain a forwarding structure, and they are inefficient in UAV networks due to the unique characteristics of UAVs, such as high-speed movement and sparse distribution. For many UAV applications, the trajectories of UAVs are pre-planned in advance through mission planning and trajectory planning, and the location and motion information of UAVs can be obtained through positioning technology and inertial sensors. In this paper, we propose an efficient Trajectory-Based Multicast (TBM) routing protocol for UAV networks. TBM utilizes the trajectory information to compute the encounters between UAVs, then a priority metric that characterizes the ability of a UAV to forward a message to multiple destination nodes is calculated. Based on the priority metric, TBM constructs a priority encounter graph, which considers the timeliness and stability of message forwarding, thus finding a multicast forwarding sequence with low delay and high delivery ratio. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TBM. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 7; Conference name: 22nd IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, 18th IEEE International Conference on Smart City and 6th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Systems, HPCC-SmartCity-DSS 2020; Conference date: 14 December 2020 through 16 December 2020; Conference code: 168653</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105352068&amp;doi=10.1109%2fHPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00115&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8820d233a0c58738edde5a399da04940</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc. - IEEE Int.

Multi-UAV systems have been used in an increasing number of mission scenarios and routing protocols play a critical role in UAV network communications. It is now well established that unstable link quality and frequently changing network topology pose significant challenges for messages forwarding in UAV networks. Hence, traditional mobile ad-hoc network routing protocols do not fit well in UAV networks. In many UAV applications, the flight paths of UAVs are planned in advance before performing missions. The positions and motion information of UAVs are available through Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial sensors, which can be utilized to calculate the future positions of UAVs. Therefore, the future topology of the UAV network is also available. However, existing work does not take advantage of this information. Based on the trajectory, location and motion information of the UAVs, this paper proposes a future network topology-aware routing (FNTAR) protocol, which uses future location information to make superior routing decisions. Moreover, to mitigate data loss problems caused by unstable links and highly dynamic topology, FNTAR can forward messages to multiple excellent next-hop UAVs based on future network topology, and these UAVs can deliver messages to destinations faster. We implement FNTAR in the simulation experiment, the simulation results demonstrate that FNTAR can achieve lower latency and higher delivery ratio than DTNgeo protocol. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Conference name: 2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC 2020; Conference date: 25 May 2020 through 28 May 2020; Conference code: 161344</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087280490&amp;doi=10.1109%2fWCNC45663.2020.9120842&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bac9006ab7e7eeaeb50064a3005b14b0</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Wireless Commun.

The resource constraints and dynamic nature of the swarm bring critical challenges to the design of UAV routing protocols. Most of the conventional ad hoc routing schemes are not intelligent and cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of UAV swarming networks. On the other hand, some artificial intelligence (AI)-based routing schemes may consume significant computational resources in the UAVs. In this article, a low-cost, adaptive routing protocol, namely skeleton-based swarm routing (SSR), is proposed, which exploits an intelligent online learning algorithm and the topology features of the mission-driven UAV swarm to distribute the traffic over optimal routes. Here, the skeleton represents the most stable parts of the swarm formation. SSR architecture consists of three modules: 1) A geometric addressing module, which assigns geometric coordinates to each node based on the swarm skeleton structure; 2) A leaf-like routing pipe which allows the selection of multiple candidate routes around the shortest path; 3) An intelligent low-complexity learning model which determines how to distribute the packets inside the routing pipe to achieve load-balanced, high-throughput transmissions. The proposed skeleton-based scheme can also facilitate the UAV formation construction and morphing. The simulation results show that the proposed SSR protocol can noticeably improve the network performance (up to 100% throughput improvement) compared to the single path routing schemes, such as the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and link-quality and traffic-load aware optimized link state routing (LTA-OLSR) protocols. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: F.

Lacking the effective control and communication algorithms is impeding the development of multi-UAV systems significantly. In this paper, distributed optimal flocking control and network co-design problem has been investigated for networked multi-UAV system in presence of uncertain harsh environment and unknown dynamics. First, the mathematical interaction between network imperfections and practical wireless network channel performance has been investigate. Then, a novel co-model has been developed for networked multi-UAV combining effects from physical system and network channel model effectively. Then, adopting neuro dynamics programming (NDP) technique and actor-critic-identifier (ACI) design architecture, a novel online finite horizon optimal flocking control and network co-design has been proposed. The developed algorithm cannot merely obtain the distributed optimal co-design within finite time, but also relax the stringent requirement about physical UAV system and network dynamics. In addition, developed novel co-design can satisfy the practical constraints, e.g. transmit power constraint etc. The Lyapunov stability analysis is used to validate the effectiveness of developed scheme. With the proper NN weight update law, proposed co-design can ensure all closed-loop signals and NN weights are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Furthermore, simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme. © 2017 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Conference name: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017; Conference date: 11 April 2017 through 13 April 2017; Conference code: 128631; CODEN: PSISD</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025141412&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.2262877&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c096d1ae2d38ce7fd8509ec464ed1327</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coelho, A.</author><author>Almeida, E.N.</author><author>Silva, P.</author><author>Ruela, J.</author><author>Campos, R.</author><author>Ricardo, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RedeFINE: Centralized Routing for High-capacity Multi-hop Flying Networks</title><secondary-title>International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Int.

Within a swarm, UAVs communicate by means of a Flying Multi-hop Network (FMN), which due to its dynamics induces frequent changes of network topology and quality of the links. Recently, UAVs have also been used to provide Internet access and enhance the capacity of existing networks in Temporary Events. This brings up additional routing challenges not yet addressed, in order to provide always-on and high capacity paths able to meet the Quality of Service expected by the users.This paper presents RedeFINE, a centralized routing solution for FMNs that selects high-capacity paths between UAVs and avoids communications disruptions, by defining in advance the forwarding tables and the instants they shall be updated in the UAVs; this represents a major step forward with respect to traditional routing protocols. The performance evaluation of RedeFINE shows promising results, especially regarding Throughput and Packet Delivery Ratio, when compared with state of the art routing solutions. © 2018 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Conference name: 14th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications, WiMob 2018; Conference date: 15 October 2018 through 17 October 2018; Conference code: 143866</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060807815&amp;doi=10.1109%2fWiMOB.2018.8589098&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b465087fafa5ec00bd5552e5480d08bf</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Int.

The objective of the RAS project is to develop a distributed multi-layer autonomous UAS planning and control technology for gathering intelligence in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) environments populated by intelligent adaptive adversaries. These resilient autonomous systems are able to navigate through hostile environments while collecting intelligence and minimizing the loss of assets. Our approach incorporates artificial life concepts, with the high-level architecture divided into three biologically inspired meta-layers: cyber-physical, reactive, and deliberative. Each meta-layer is a combination of N layers, each representing simple behavior, and collectively having a dynamic level of influence over the behavior of the agent. Algorithms within each layer act on a combination of perceptions, memory, and intents. Perceptions represent a filtered view of reality, abstracted in the layer immediately below, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next highest layer. Intents represent a recommended action output from the layer above, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next lowest layer. Each cycle, perceptions and intents are cleared. Memory permeates each layer, and allows the layers to retain some knowledge from previous cycles. Fast-reactive control systems in low meta-layers ensure a stable environment supporting cognitive function on higher meta-layers. The key concepts of our approach are: A layered architecture of intelligence on a spectrum from reactive to deliberative; the use of artificial life algorithms providing robust, complex behavior from a set of simple rules; communication of information between agents via observation; the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to assist the team in selecting and adapting the best solutions for each layer. This distributed cooperative system of intelligent assets will provide adaptable, scalable performance to accomplish mission goals in challenging environments. © 2018 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 37th IEEE/AIAA International Digital Avionics Systems Conference, DASC 2018; Conference date: 23 September 2018 through 27 September 2018; Conference code: 143574; CODEN: ADACF</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060579882&amp;doi=10.1109%2fDASC.2018.8569720&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bac2f1bf98829342fe11b3f9283121e2</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Velazco, J.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Omnidirectional Optical Communicator</title><secondary-title>IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Aerosp.

The ISOC will allow superfast cross-links and will be a technology enabler for swarms and formation flying spacecraft. The ISOC under development features a truncated dodecahedron geometry that can hold an array of fast photodiode detectors and gimbal-less MEMS scanning mirrors. The main goals of the ISOC development include: 1) full sky coverage, 2) Gbps data rates and 3) the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous links. We have developed two omnidirectional communicator prototypes capable of full-duplex operation. We are using advanced single-mode laser diodes operating at 850 nm capable of producing hundreds of milliwatts of laser radiation. We are also employing MEMS-based beam steering mirrors, and fast PIN photodiodes to achieve long-range communications. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve full duplex operation at 1 Gbps data rates over 200 km and slightly lower data rates at longer distances. In this paper we describe the overall ISOC architecture and present the design tradeoffs for gigabit data-rate operation. We also present preliminary NRZ On-Off Keying communications simulation results obtained using our optical link budget model. The ISOC is ideally suited for crosslink communications among small spacecraft, especially for those forming a swarm and/or a constellation. Small spacecraft furnished with ISOC communications systems, should be able to communicate at gigabit per second rates over long distances. This data rate enhancement can allow real-time, global science measurements and/or ultra-high fidelity observations from tens or hundreds of Earth-orbiting satellites, or permit high-bandwidth, direct-to-earth communications for planetary missions. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: J.E.

However, being a technology in development, the security and vulnerability of the swarm of robots against possible cybernetic attacks have been commonly overlooked. This is of major concern when executing mission-critical activities that inherently require an adequate management of security. In this work, a bio-inspired security mechanism applied to a swarm of robots is proposed. Through computer simulations, it is observed how the mechanism, when executing a homing towards a stationary landmark, allows the swarm of robots to identify abnormal behaviors, caused by a certain cyberattack; subsequently, it establishes a certain tolerance to it and allows to improve the level of availability that is required to continue executing the task at hand. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.

Autonomous vehicles must embed the capabilities to supervise their behaviour and to detect and react to such events.

This paper describes the Robot System Onboard Architecture (RSOA) software developed in the SWARMs project for the achievement of offshore maritime operations. This generic and modular architecture implements high level capabilities in a semiautonomous or autonomous manner, and is deployed at a lower level on a heterogeneous swarm of vehicles.

The mathematic model of coalition formation is built on basis of the minimum attacking time and the minimum coalition size with satisfying resources and simultaneous strikes requirements. A communication protocol based on maximum number of hops is developed to determine the potential coalition members in dynamic network. A multistage sub-optimal coalition formation algorithm (MSOCFA) with polynomial time is established. The performances of MSOCFA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are compared in terms of complexity, mission performance and computational time. A complex scenario is deployed to illustrate how the coalitions are formed and validate the feasibility of the MSOCFA. The effect of communication constraints (hop delay and max-hops) on mission performance is studied. The results show that it is beneficial to determine potential coalition members in a wide and deep range over the network in the presence of less delay. However, when the delays are significant, it is more advantageous to determine coalitions from among the immediate neighbors. © 2017, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) has identified at least twenty enabling and enhancing goals to fulfill the existing lunar exploration Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG). Several of these goals will require multi-asset missions to the surface of the Moon involving human and machine interaction, as well as access to a ground station on Earth. Therefore, a communication enabling constellation deployed around the moon will serve as a crucial enabling technology for such missions. However, the limited orbital stability of lunar orbits constrains the use of traditional central body orbits for designing these constellations. The Earth-Moon Lagrange points, on the other hand, offer a viable location to deploy these constellations. The stationarity of the Lagrange points coupled with the fact that they have a large line of sight access area to the Moon's surface makes them a viable candidate for deploying constellations with a minimal number of spacecraft. However, the design of a Lagrange point constellation mission is not straight forward. This involves selecting the Lagrange points that offer the optimal coverage, optimal quasi-stationary trajectories around these Lagrange points, the optimal transfer to these trajectories, and the design of the constituent spacecraft. Clearly, this multi-disciplinary problem can benefit from a unifying mission design architecture that simultaneously handles the above-mentioned challenges. In our previous work, we developed the Integrated Design Engineering and Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software do design swarm missions to solar system small bodies. This work will focus on extending the capability of the IDEAS architecture to design optimal constellations deployed at the Earth-Moon Lagrange points. The constellation will be designed to act as a relay network to Earth with a minimum number of spacecraft. The performance of the constellation will be noted by studying the accessible regions on the surface of the moon. The approach taken by this work is as follows. We begin by modeling the coverage of spacecraft antenna by studying the accessible areas. The spacecraft will be assumed to be in halo orbits about the colinear Lagrange points. A selection scheme for the halo orbits is then discussed in order to coverage, synchronization, and stability requirements. Finally, the principles described are demonstrated by designing a Lagrange point constellation with three spacecraft that have access to at least 85 % of the Moon's surface and can communicate with at least 70 % of the surface at any given instant. The requirements and performance of this constellation are then evaluated assuming state-of-the-art hardware capabilities. The results indicate successful performance of the developed algorithms thus enabling the IDEAS architecture to generate holistic optimal designs which will greatly increase the returns of the future missions to the Moon. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Conference name: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020; Conference date: 7 March 2020 through 14 March 2020; Conference code: 162583</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089296933&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO47225.2020.9172381&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=21b89f9505a6780c421bc44fac4a0061</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Aerosp.

Dynamic, delay and disruption tolerant communications and networking topologies at various Quality of Service levels are needed to meet future mission requirements, which may include multiple spacecraft flying in formation and coordinating among themselves. Additionally, secure proximity-and autonomous-communication among various types of space vehicles are needed to share rich, near real-Time streams of information. Along with scalability and extensibility, cybersecurity is a crucial requirement for autonomous communications in space.TaraCoAP is based on the terrestrial standard Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and along with its Cyber-Physical Autonomous Asset Observation and Management extension provides delay and disruption tolerant, autonomous communication among swarms or clusters of spacecraft to implement complex and time-varying networks to coordinate, collaborate and share rich streams of information.

Complex formation configurations can be of interest to be the central element in an exhibition or maximize surface coverage for surveillance of a specific area. Existing algorithms that enable complex configurations usually require a centralized control, a communication protocol among the swarm in order to achieve consensus, or predefined instructions for individual agents. Nonetheless, trivial shapes such as flocks can be accomplished with low sensing and interaction requirements. We propose a pattern formation algorithm that enables a variety of shape configurations with a distributed, communication-free and index-free implementation with collision avoidance. Our algorithm is based on a formation definition that does not require indexing of the agents. We show the potential of the algorithm by simulating the formation of non-trivial shapes such as a wedge and a T-shaped configuration. We compare the performance of the algorithm for single and double integrator models for the dynamics of the agents. Finally, we run a preliminary test of our algorithm by implementing it with a group of small cars equipped with a Lidar for sensing and orientation calculation. © 2019 The Authors.

In this paper we focus on using multiple UAVs to cooperatively monitor a crowded area. Communication in such UAVs network is an ongoing project. Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result.

Large satellite swarms, opportunistic satellite networks or heterogeneous constellations hybridizing small-spacecraft nodes with high-performance satellites are becoming feasible and advantageous alternatives requiring the adoption of new operation paradigms that enhance their autonomy. While autonomy is a notion that is gaining acceptance in monolithic satellite missions, it can also be deemed an integral characteristic in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). In this context, this paper focuses on the motivations for system-level autonomy in DSS and justifies its need as an enabler of system qualities. Autonomy is also presented as a necessary feature to bring new distributed Earth observation functions (which require coordination and collaboration mechanisms) and to allow for novel structural functions (e.g., opportunistic coalitions, exchange of resources, or in-orbit data services). Mission Planning and Scheduling (MPS) frameworks are then presented as a key component to implement autonomous operations in satellite missions. An exhaustive knowledge classification explores the design aspects of MPS for DSS, and conceptually groups them into: components and organizational paradigms; problem modeling and representation; optimization techniques and metaheuristics; execution and runtime characteristics and the notions of tasks, resources, and constraints. This paper concludes by proposing future strands of work devoted to study the trade-offs of autonomy in large-scale, highly dynamic and heterogeneous networks through frameworks that consider some of the limitations of small spacecraft technologies. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 42; Correspondence Address: C.

With this rapid growth, studies using UAVs are underway in various areas. UAVs are more economical and effective when utilizing several nodes rather than operating a single aircraft. In general, UAVs collect and transmit information to the control center (CC), and act on control commands from the CC. Communication between UAVs and the control center is usually achieved using modules such as radio frequency (RF), Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and cellular. However, when multiple UAVs communicate directly with the CC, the limitations of communication technologies and problems with increasing nodes occur. To address these points, several studies have constructed an ad-hoc network of UAVs to address the limitations of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication range, or the high cost of cellular systems. However, previous studies have constructed fixed topology ad-hoc networks. These studies did not take into account the problem of changing network topology due to the rapid mobility and frequent formation changes of UAVs. Due to this, limits occurred such that UAVs moved only in the pre-built topology. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topology construction protocol for UAV swarms to address this problem. The main contents of this paper are as follows. We first look at the research and limitations of existing UAV communications, and propose a protocol to solve this problem. This paper proposes a protocol for UAV construction of ad-hoc networks when trying to perform missions using multiple UAVs, and also describes how the changed network topology is reconstructed when network topology changes due to changes in flight formation. Finally, we establish a situation and apply the proposed protocol, analyze the results and describe further required research. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: S.

Evolutionary algorithms are a conventional method to solve complex optimization problems with multiple constraints. However, they are time-consuming algorithms which make their implementation difficult. UAV path planning is usually a real-time problem that is needed to solve in limited time steps. Parallelization is one of the most effective methods for reducing the computation time of evolutionary algorithms. In the industrial applications, usually there is a communication platform between devices which can be used for the implementation of the parallelization process. For example, controller area network (CAN) is a protocol used for reliable communication in aerospace systems. Due to the development of this protocol on UAVs and its characteristics, it can be used for parallel optimization of path planning problem. In this paper, an asynchronous distributed multi-master parallel genetic algorithm and a parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm are implemented on CAN bus to improve the speed and performance of the UAV path planning. © 2019, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: V.

This warrants both, day-ahead planning of larger schedules for power plants, as well as short-term contracting to counter forecast deviations or to accommodate dynamics of the intra-day markets. In addition, the geographic distribution of renewable energy sources forces scheduling algorithms with a hugely different communication link qualities. In this paper, we present an extension to the Lightweight Power Exchange Protocol (LPEP), dubbed LPEP++. It draws on the strength of the LPEP to find the optimal solution of the combinatorial power demand-supply problem with string guarantees in acceptable time and extends it with facilities for long-term planning, parallel negotiations and reduces its memory footprint.

Commonly, multi-UAV systems require to reach and maintain a specific flight formation during mission execution. This can be achieved by using a distributed UAV formation control strategy in which each UAV has a flight controller whose function is to calculate the control actions for the UAV actuators such that the UAV formation is maintained. To perform this task, the control strategy requires the reliable and timely exchange of information within the UAV formation. The information that is needed by the controller is commonly referred to as state information (SI). It has been assumed that SI can be properly disseminated by means of multi-hop communications, i.e., by deploying a flying ad-hoc network (FANET). In this sense, multi-hop broadcast protocols (MBPs) that were previously proposed for mobile and vehicular ad-hoc networks seem to be suited for this task. However, previous work dealing with distributed UAV formation control has made communication and networking assumptions that would be hard to fulfill in actual FANET deployments. Moreover, the efficiency of the MBPs to disseminate SI within a FANET remains unexplored. The goal of this paper is to analyze how the network performance offered by different MBPs impacts the effectiveness of distributed UAV formation control to maintain UAV formation. An evaluation framework to perform this task is proposed in this paper. The simulation results demonstrate the relevance of MBP performance in SI message dissemination and thus in the ability of the controller to maintain a formation. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

To handle mobility, the MWSN node should be much more efficient than the nodes in static WSN. Moreover, a MWSN node should be capable of handling real time mobility control, path planning and navigation. The application domains of MWSN can be further expanded by incorporating swarm like intelligence in MWSN. We have developed a low cost, small form factor hardware platform which will function as a node in MWSN using custom off the shelf(COTS) products. Our mobile hardware platform, henceforth called as BSwarm robot supports self-assembly, to achieve complex tasks. The platform also support image assisted navigation and provides extensive I/O support for further feature expansion. The testbed consisting of multiple BSwarm robot can be utilized for the development and validation of algorithms/protocols related to MWSNs, distributed control of Swarm robots, real time image processing etc. BSwarm robot is a multi processor based robot designed in such a way that it can be used for applications which may demand varied degree of processing, communication and input-output capabilities. This paper also highlights major factors that can be taken into consideration while choosing the hardware platform for MWSNs so that the protocol stack development for MWSNs becomes easier. © 2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems, SPICES 2015; Conference date: 19 February 2015 through 21 February 2015; Conference code: 112047</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937127942&amp;doi=10.1109%2fSPICES.2015.7091533&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=271bd9ce5364a2e927903ca9d8622fdb</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Int.

The problem is aggravated under wireless connectivity that may be slower and less reliable, compared to wired connections. To tackle this issue, we investigate fundamental relationships between consensus latency and reliability through the lens of wireless connectivity, and co-design communication and consensus protocols for low-latency and reliable decentralized systems. Specifically, we propose a novel communication-efficient distributed consensus protocol, termed random representative consensus (R2C), and show its effectiveness under gossip and broadcast communication protocols. To this end, we derive a closed-form end-To-end (E2E) latency expression of the R2C that guarantees target reliability, and compare it with a baseline consensus protocol, referred to as referendum consensus (RC). The result shows that the R2C is faster compared to the RC and more reliable compared when co-designed with the broadcast protocol compared to that with the gossip protocol. © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: W.

Such a task requires angular resolutions of less than 0.2 arc-seconds in extreme ultraviolet, which cannot be economically done with a conventional space telescope. Performing such a mission requires unprecedented relative navigation tolerances, a need for active collision avoidance, a development of inter-satellite communication, and a propulsion system that enables the relative navigation maneuvers. The mission was initially conceived as a three 3U satellite formation in the NSF CubeSat Innovations Ideas Lab to address NSF science goals with innovative technologies. Once beginning conceptual subsystem design, it was evident that significant constraints linked to the three 3U satellite formation configuration limit the likelihood of mission success and increase mission risk. A trade study was conducted to determine potential resolutions to the problems associated with the initial three 3U satellite formation configuration. The completion of the trade study resulted in a major design change to a two 6U satellite configuration that resolved the issues associated with the initial configuration, improved mission success while reducing risk, and intends to incorporate novel CubeSat technologies, all of which enable the mission to move forward. This paper discusses the path that led the team to conduct the trade study, the design alternatives considered, and the innovative subsystem technologies that were conceived as a result of updating the satellite formation configuration. © 2020 The MITRE Corporation.

The primary reason for this increase is that UAVs eliminate the risk to human life in difficult and dangerous missions, are cost effective, and easily are deployed. Developments in UAV technology and decreasing costs have increased UAV usage. However, when multiple UAVs are deployed, inter UAV communication becomes complicated. For this reason, communication in multi-UAV systems is the most important problem that needs to be solved. To enable communication among UAVs without infrastructure support, a Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) is used. A FANET provides UAVs to fly in tandem without colliding. To ensure coordinated flight, UAVs require the location information of other UAVs. In this study, we developed a common channel multi-token circulation protocol to share location information in multi-UAV systems that communicate using a FANET. The proposed method ensures that UAVs in multi-UAV systems know each other's coordinate information with minimum error. © 2019 Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

In order to create a vantage point, young professionals and students from the four corners of the earth had performed a comprehensive study at the 2014 Space Generation Congress in Toronto, Canada under "CubeSat Swarms Communication Networks and Policy Challenges" working group. While potential possibilities are endless for the structure of Cubesat networks, decisions made amongst the group were based on existing technologies and guidelines. Therefore, the working group discussed (1) short and long term technical challenges (2) policy requirements, (3) radio communication bandwidth limitations, (4) data collection and transmission regulations and (5) the standardization of the CubeSat communication system. Technical challenges for small satellite missions involve limitations of link budgets, the size of the déployable high gain antennas, optical and laser communication and the restriction of the link budget due to the interferences. In addition, policy issues have immaturities for frequency allocation and registration complimenting the short lifespan of CubeSats. The standardization of mission operations enables a space communication network architecture that of which is similar to the internet, incorporated into CubeSat Swarms. The group suggests a CubeSat network system architecture including inter-swarm and intra-swarm constellations, optical and laser communications and delay-tolerant networks (DTN). The proposed CubeSat communication network also consists of inter-swarm constellation communications along with intra-swarm constellations sustained through four different basic data links, a mother-daughter satellite framework, and net-neutrality throughout the network. In the meantime, policy regulation recommendations allow global communication by reducing data downlink time. Governments, as well as service providers, treat all data used online the same regardless of its origins, platform, and users. The standardization of the CubeSat network system was formed by operator expectations for high downlink speeds, equal priority for data transfers, and streamlined registrations. The simplified registration process for CubeSat-Swarms is more efficient by establishing new baseline legal framework, rules, and standards. This would help all users and operators in this sector, including entrepreneurs, licensing bodies, and end-users. Saving time for everyone while achieving maximum efficiency, utilization of the time and results are the end result of proposed system architecture by the working group.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 66th International Astronautical Congress 2015: Space - The Gateway for Mankind's Future, IAC 2015; Conference date: 12 October 2015 through 16 October 2015; Conference code: 122921</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991782135&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=118acb22e0cf64cd920f6d2b6cff0361</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc.

Furthermore, a system based on a swarm of UAVs is attracting much attention for its efficiency of a mission execution performance compare to a single UAV system. However, to support those scenarios, communication path should be maintained among UAVs and ground control station, therefore guaranteeing a reliable ad hoc network is an important issue. Regarding this, in this paper, we provide development of flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) routing protocol and UAV-based testbeds environments which can be used for the experimentation for the developed routing protocol in which they consist of ground control station (GCS), multi-UAV system, network topology monitor, and 802.11p FANET communication modem. © 2019 The Vertical Flight Society.

More than 40 missions have targeted Mars, and over 100 have been sent to the moon. Space agencies continue to focus on developing novel strategies and technologies for probing celestial bodies. Multirobot systems are particularly promising for planetary exploration, as they are more robust to individual failure and have the potential to examine larger areas; however, there are limits to how many robots an operator can control individually. We recently took part in the European Space Agency's (ESA's) interdisciplinary equipment test campaign (PANGAEA-X) at a lunar/Mars analog site in Lanzarote, Spain. We used a heterogeneous fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-a swarm-to study the interplay of systems operations and human factors. Human operators directed the swarm via ad hoc networks and data-sharing protocols to explore unknown areas under two control modes: in one, the operator instructed each robot separately; in the other, the operator provided general guidance to the swarm, which self-organized via a combination of distributed decision making and consensus building. We assessed cognitive load via pupillometry for each condition and perceived task demand and intuitiveness via selfreport. Our results show that implementing higher autonomy with swarm intelligence can reduce workload, freeing the operator for other tasks such as overseeing strategy and communication. Future work will further leverage advances in swarm intelligence for exploration missions. © 1994-2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 24; CODEN: IRAME</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081352237&amp;doi=10.1109%2fMRA.2019.2940413&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6d3014b56edc6ccc4f2db002505f318a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olcay, E.</author><author>Schuhmann, F.</author><author>Lohmann, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collective navigation of a multi-robot system in an unknown environment</title><secondary-title>Robotics and Autonomous Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Robotics and Autonomous Systems</full-title><abbr-1>Rob Autom Syst</abbr-1></periodical><volume>132</volume><keywords><keyword>Navigation</keyword><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Industrial robots</keyword><keyword>Multipurpose robots</keyword><keyword>Communication architectures</keyword><keyword>Unknown environments</keyword><keyword>Multi-robot systems</keyword><keyword>Agricultural robots</keyword><keyword>Data Sharing</keyword><keyword>Autonomous systems</keyword><keyword>Changing environment</keyword><keyword>Robot learning</keyword><keyword>Cooperative control</keyword><keyword>Communication range</keyword><keyword>Collective navigation</keyword><keyword>Prior knowledge</keyword><keyword>Sensing information</keyword><keyword>Target position</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>09218890 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.robot.2020.103604</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The navigation of autonomous, mobile multi-robot systems in changing environments is a challenging problem investigated over the past years. Cooperative, multiple robots are employed for many different tasks to increase the efficiency and success of a mission. However, many of the existing collective path planning approaches do not guarantee a reliable escape in environments with complex, non-convex obstacles without any prior knowledge. In this study, we developed a navigation framework for multi-robot systems in unknown areas that solely exploit the sensing information and shared data among the agents. The key contribution of this paper is the simultaneous, collision-free motion planning for fully autonomous robots in a collective manner. Furthermore, our communication architecture enables the robots to find an appropriate path to a desired, joint target position, despite the limited sensing and communication range. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: E.

This may lead a node to drain their energy and also affect the performance of routing protocol and network lifetime. Several researches have gone so far for predicting node lifetime and link lifetime. To address this problem a new algorithm has been developed which utilizes the network parameters relating to dynamic nature of nodes viz. energy drain rate, relative mobility estimation to predict the route lifetime. But this has given a problem of network congestion and delay. To mitigate this problem, in this paper we have implemented an algorithm which uses the prediction parameters that are fuzzified and fuzzy rules have been formed to decide on the node status. This status information is made to exchange among all the nodes. Before every transmission the status of each and every node is verified. Even for a weak node, the performance of a route recovery mechanism is made in such a way that corresponding routes are diverted to the strong nodes. Thereby it reduces the data loss and communication overhead using PSO prediction algorithm and here NS2 simulator is used for simulation. © 2016 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Conference name: 2nd IEEE International Conference on Technological Innovations in ICT for Agriculture and Rural Development, TIAR 2016; Conference date: 15 July 2016 through 16 July 2016; Conference code: 125652</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010669787&amp;doi=10.1109%2fTIAR.2016.7801221&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e167d359843f416d73014c01bc3f24c6</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc. - IEEE Int.

Common to these flight controllers is the use of the Micro Air Vehicle Communications Protocol (MAVLink) that allows the flight controller to communicate with a ground control station. However, it is still challenging to experiment with multiple such aerial vehicles concurrently. To this end, we have developed an open software/hardware platform-the University at Buffalo's Airborne Networking and Communications testbed (UB-ANC)-that facilitates rapid development and deployment of multi-drone applications. In this paper, we present the UB-ANC Emulator, an emulation environment to design, implement, and test various applications (missions) involving one or more drones in software, and provides seamless transition to experimentation. We validate the UB-ANC Emulator's output against experimental data collected in a mission with three networked drones to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy, and we demonstrate its scalability up to 100 drones using a simulated 'leader-follower' mission. © 2016 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Conference name: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots, SIMPAR 2016; Conference date: 13 December 2016 through 16 December 2016; Conference code: 126624</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015911261&amp;doi=10.1109%2fSIMPAR.2016.7862404&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d38e9848f21a0435b897a73c2d71c336</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Int.

Mission-critical applications are becoming a vital category of future IoT applications, and due to the advancements in the 5G, the design of mission-critical application overcome a big hurdle. Mission-critical applications must be reliable, and the output should be known in advance. Therefore, to model such application, architecture is considered the cornerstone. One of the major requirements is the flexibility of the operation and the adaptability to new devices. In this paper, an optimal orchestration mechanism is proposed to automate the processes in a conventional multi-device and multi-task mission-critical architecture for flexible and scalable operations. The central goal of this paper is to threefold; first, to model tasks in such a way to maximize the flexibility in the operation plane. Secondly, to design a strongly correlated pair which has maximum relation and thus the chance to hit the task on the devices will be potentially maximized and also the idle time among operations is minimal. Lastly, to register devices in a network which is optimal for the group of this device in terms of correlation. We propose a multi-layer particle swarm optimization for each of the optimization objectives. Results show that the operation plan is flexible and with scaling up the problem size, the orchestration is still graceful and within the requirements of mission-critical applications. The performance of multi-level particle swarm optimization is compared with conventional single-level particle swarm optimization and it has been learned that the later is not only slower but also less accurate. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: D.

With the possibility of diminished UHF relay assets for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission, supporting such a technology requires a high performance antenna array system in order to enable substantial return of valuable scientific data. We propose a novel X-band single feed circularly polarized antenna subarray comprised of half E-shaped elements, optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization. The subarray architecture is modular, fed by a waveguide feed network, enabling high power handling capability.

Many corporate proposals already explore satellite constellations as the backbone of a global, space-based Internet service [1], [2]. However, these constellation proposals are usually owned by a single entity or conglomerate, and operated to serve a particular business model. Building on the theme of crowd-sharing models and innovative research in distributed system-control algorithms, we propose a constellation-management system and multi-functional CubeSat hardware platform that would allow communal use of satellite functionality, including opportunities for non-conflicting concurrent processes and re-purposing of satellite hardware. By coupling communication and data ledger protocols (e.g. modified blockchains) with machine learning algorithms for smart task distribution and execution management, this research describes a way to orchestrate peer-to-peer network collaborations where satellite constellation functionality is dynamically rented, shared or reused between many applications. We envision multi-purpose, shared- use satellite constellations, bringing this category of space hardware into the “on-demand” services market (along the lines of Amazon Web Services, but for broad space applications) and moving beyond more narrow applications of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) currently deployed in orbit [3]. This model for allocation of a shared research resource, where a ledger is kept to distribute access fairly, builds on years of scientific collaboration processes [4] created around expensive, limited-use hardware resources (e.g., multinational collaborations that split time on large telescopes or the CERN particle accelerator [5]). This research proposes to automate and enhance this process, exploring remote-activation and operations of space-based resources. This paper will discuss the BlockSat mission architecture and ConOps (Concept of Operations), showing how the integration of a multi-functional hardware platform and cloud-computing participation model can create a new class of small satellite operations. We aim to free satellite deployments from the limitations of single-use applications and propose a new “open space” market that can democratize access to LEO space technology.

In addition, the increasing capabilities of the computer vision in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and obstacles localization allow to integrate an efficient and robust multi-vision based navigation system thus supplying learning capacity. This architecture is typical of an autonomous rover, i.e. a mobile platform which is able to navigate, to plan and follow a safe path without human remote control. These skills are obviously mandatory requirements for space missions like planetary or asteroid exploration. Till now, typical missions has been characterized by non-cooperative autonomous rovers working in different and quite far areas. Increased availability of performing autonomous platforms now suggests to plan missions involving a swarm of cooperative rovers exploring a predefined area of a planet, an asteroid or a comet, with a common target. Coordination leads to versatility and lower cost in terms of data return. The logic of cooperation is based on the fact that each member of the swarm shares a set of information that might help the others in achieving their tasks. The paper describes a possible system architecture of a swarm of two small rovers designed, built and tested at the Guidance and Navigation Lab of Università di Roma "La Sapienza". The goal of the mission is to reach a common and pre-assigned target position - a hypothetic scientific post on the surface of a planet - while exploring and analysing the surrounding environment. The coordinates of a localised obstacles are shared with the other member in order to build a common and continuously upgradable map of the environment and a database of available safe paths. The whole architecture of the designed autonomous guidance and vision-based navigation system together with the communication system are presented in detail.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: M.

The ISOC has the potential to enable up to 1 Gbps data rates over a distance up to 200 km in free space. Key features of the ISOC include full sky coverage and the ability to maintain multiple links simultaneously. The Q4 mission consists of (4) 6U CubeSats furnished with ISOCs to demonstrate high data rate communications among the spacecraft. More specifically, we seek to demonstrate the omnidirectionality of the ISOC by providing simultaneous optical links between one spacecraft and the other three. Q4 will be a demonstrator for small spacecraft swarm capabilities. Following a proposed deployment from the ISS, the CubeSats will utilize their onboard thrusters to enter their desired orbit. The orbit consists of one 'leader' spacecraft in a circular orbit with a 400 km LEO altitude and three 'follower' spacecraft in slightly elliptical orbits rotating azimuthally about the leader. The main mission will consist of three consecutive phases: First, the spacecraft will demonstrate pointing, acquisition, and tracking using newly developed protocols. Next, link establishment and different channel access methods (CDMA and TDMA) will be tested. Finally, Delay Tolerant Network protocols will be implemented to allow fast data sharing among the spacecraft. The distance between the communicating spacecraft will be increased as the mission progresses to characterize the link quality as a function of distance. All communications over the course of the mission will be recorded and analyzed on the ground using bit error rate as a metric for success. The current design for each the four Q4 CubeSats contains an XACT advanced ADCS system for precision beam pointing. Other components currently under consideration include MiPS cold gas thrusters for orbital maneuvering and gimbaled eHaWK 84W solar arrays. In this paper we present design considerations for the Q4 CubeSats, link budget calculations, results from preliminary mission analysis, and expected results. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020; Conference date: 7 March 2020 through 14 March 2020; Conference code: 162583</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092568465&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO47225.2020.9172329&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cb0053ab7978d1c43bd087955b7804ec</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Aerosp.

But in the previous work, it is assumed that each LEO satellites could directly connect with the GEO controllers. This is unreasonable when the LEO data plane is a large-scale LEO satellite constellation, as the number of GEO controllers and antennas of each GEO controller are limited. In this work, we propose a design of software defined large-scale LEO satellite networks with limited GEO controllers, where the communication between GEO control plane and LEO data plane is achieved by limited cross-layer links. In this model, the selection of cross-layer links directly affects the load balance among GEO controllers and the latencies of control paths, which will deeply influence the latency of routing response. Thus, we propose a switching-aware dynamic control path planning scheme to handle this, where we propose a switching-time selection scheme to handle the impact of switching and a multi-objective optimization problem to deal with the selection of cross-layer links, and finally present a particle swarm optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the better performance on reducing the bad influence of switching, optimizing the load balance among controllers and the average latencies of control paths. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: T.

Swarm-based architectures -which comprise multiple agents operating collectively as a distributed system- have been proposed for Earth observation, astronomy, planetary exploration, and heliophysics. Some of the key technology demonstration missions have already successfully flown in the past decades. The increasing interest in satellite swarms suggests that this innovative architecture will be adopted in a variety of future missions in the coming years, raising the question of how to dispose of satellite swarms at the end of their operational lifetimes. Mega-constellations or swarms comprising of numerous small satellites are difficult to track by Earth-based networks. They also increase the risk of collisions, particularly during end-of-life when these small satellites cannot be maneuvered to avoid collisions with functional satellite systems. Previously, distributed small satellite missions such as KickSat-2 and SpaceBEES 1-4 were designed to passively deorbit and burn up during atmospheric re-entry at the end of their lifetimes. However, disposing of satellite swarms outside low LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) has no trivial solution which both meets space situational awareness requirements and aligns with the philosophy of space sustainability. The distributed functionality which makes swarm missions so flexible and adaptable also means that many individual swarm agents have to be disposed of at end-of-life, rendering traditional approaches such as migration to the GEO (Geosynchronous Earth Orbit) graveyard orbit problematic. The challenges of disposing satellite swarms are as varied as the environments they could operate in - swarms used for planetary exploration will have to respect planetary protection policies while swarms engaged in Earth observation missions will have to be safely deorbited amidst an increasingly crowded LEO environment. In this paper we explore how the autonomy and distributed nature of swarms both complicates end-of-life disposal and simultaneously enables novel solutions to post-mission disposal. We then survey existing end-of-life scenarios for satellite swarms and propose a novel research approach to swarm disposal that could comply with both legal requirements and the philosophy of space sustainability.

The S-Band Network for co-operating Satellites (S-Net) is a cluster of four nanosats developed by the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (TUB) and successfully launched in 2018 from Vostochny cosmodrome. S-Net is designed to verify an S-band transceiver developed by the company IQ wireless and TUB and furthermore test the communications architecture for distributed nanosats developed by the TUB. Networked swarms of small satellites provide new opportunities for a large range of missions including data collection with distributed sensors, disaster monitoring or machine-to-machine communication. This paper describes the in-orbit results of the communication network architecture of the mission S Net. Three different approaches for the organization of a reliable inter-satellite networking are discussed. The first one is based on token passing through the small cluster and comes without a central spacecraft collecting the data from other nodes and distributing them. The second one is the approach with a central node and the third in a de-centralized architecture with a random access. All three architectures are based on the same physical layer with 0.5 W RF power, adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) and the same data layer protocol stack, both implemented as a digital radio in a compact single unit with a weight of approximately 0.5 kg. Furthermore, the problems of routing and antenna pointing for the mission are addressed. Finally, future work based on S-Net is discussed. Â© 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation.

Device swarms are smart, mobile, and interconnected devices that operate in large numbers and are likely to be part of emerging applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). Swarm devices process and exchange safety, privacy, and mission-critical information. Thus, it is important to have a good code verification technique that scales to device swarms and establishes trust among collaborating devices. DADS has several advantages over current state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques: It is decentralized, has no single point of failure, and can handle changing topologies after nodes are compromised. DADS assures system resilience to node compromise/failure while guaranteeing only devices that execute genuine code remain part of the group. We conduct performance measurements of communication, computation, memory, and energy using the TrustLite embedded systems architecture in OMNeT++ simulation environment. We show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce communication cost and is very efficient in terms of computation, memory, and energy requirements. We also analyze security and show that DADS is very effective and robust against various attacks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069542029&amp;doi=10.1145%2f3325822&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ce7d771a38a4413c54ad23c2a94ec2d9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Da Silva, L.C.B.</author><author>Bernardo, R.M.</author><author>De Oliveira, H.A.</author><author>Rosa, P.F.F.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Krivanek V.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-UAV agent-based coordination for persistent surveillance with dynamic priorities</title><secondary-title>ICMT 2017 - 6th International Conference on Military Technologies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ICMT - Int.

Such scenario demands continuous monitoring of the region and take account of its priority areas which will require control interactions, both in mission planning and execution. The methodology approach is based on priority gradients combined with region partitioning, where the points of greatest interest are updated more frequently. The proposed system is based on the coordination of embedded agents using spatial coordination on strategical positioning and role exchange. The system architecture is composed by three modules, namely, the ground control station, for mission planning and control through user interaction; a quadrotors team, capable of navigation by inertial and satellite systems; and the control agents embedded in aircrafts, responsible for communications, task allocation and payload mission control. The preliminary results are validated using both computer simulation and a real flight with quadrotors. Telemetry data from the results were compared and it demonstrate that the proposed methodology converges to an effective solution. © 2017 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 21; Conference name: 6th International Conference on Military Technologies, ICMT 2017; Conference date: 31 May 2017 through 2 June 2017; Conference code: 129537</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029376263&amp;doi=10.1109%2fMILTECHS.2017.7988859&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=1ca7a223269aea6d6648dfdc03af11cc</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>ICMT - Int.

These swarms can directly contact via ground control station or direct communication. However, when communicating remotely via wireless and fine maneuverability of the unmanned aerial vehicle, many mechanisms face several security gaps, such as the authentication mechanism in enemy attacks. In this study, we propose safe and effective authentication mechanism appropriate for the dynamic environment of the unmanned aerial vehicle. In the frames of this approach, a new operating mechanism in the proposed protocol is described. The protocol provides authentication security for swarms of the unmanned aerial vehicle.

This paper investigates two similar architectures for a semi-autonomous robotic swarm under a passivity-short assumption of the human operator. The two architectures differ only in the visual feedback given to the human operator. In addition, we present the proofs that both architectures ensure the objective which is position/velocity synchronization of the robotic swarm to references determined by the human. Further analysis in differences between both architectures is then presented, by considering the same velocity command from the human operator and inspecting the visual feedbacks of each architecture. In addition, the effects on the transparency of all robots' actual trajectories to the visual feedback are also discussed.

The configuration of these tasks related to single or multi-robot algorithms depends on the individual requirements of the scenario (i.e. number of entities, communication bandwidth, failure assumptions). Therefore, the developer may decide to run a path planning algorithm individually for each robot to avoid an additional exchange of information. For a scenario with a large communication bandwidth, a planner in the global context would be more suitable in order to receive an optimal result. In this paper we present an architecture that implements this decision online. Our context-aware task controller evaluates the communication situation and triggers a context switch (global, local, individual) of the task execution. By shifting the decision from design-time to run-time, we close the gap between supervision and swarm approaches and provide an optimized behavior. © 2016 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 21st IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2016; Conference date: 6 September 2016 through 9 September 2016; Conference code: 124646; CODEN: 85ROA</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84996598373&amp;doi=10.1109%2fETFA.2016.7733646&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a487119e0d5d94ef62fa86a4b3e74a65</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Int.

Multiple multicopters are coordinated using a distributed control system. The system is implemented in the Robot Operating System (ROS) and is capable of providing a real-time video stream from a UAV to one or more base stations using a wireless communications infrastructure. The system supports a heterogeneous set of UAVs and camera sensors. If necessary, an operator can interfere and reduce the autonomy. The system has been tested in an outdoor mission serving as a proof of concept.

As a critical component of an aviation swarm, airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communication capability. Considering the deficiencies of today's ATNs, it is unable to meet the communication demands of an aviation swarm, which motivates us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm and design a SDN-enabled airborne tactical network (SD-ATN). For the SDN paradigm, network monitoring information (M-info) is the source of knowledge that forms the globe network view of the control plane; therefore, how to ensure that the control plane collects M-info from the data plane in a reliable and real-time way is a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN. To address this issue, a transmission framework called the MCF-SD-ATN is first designed, which makes it practical to provide dedicated quality of service (QoS) guarantees for the M-info collection. Then, a communication protocol called the MCP-SD-ATN is designed to implement the M-info collection work based on the MCF-SD-ATN. We implement the MCF-SD-ATN and the MCP-SD-ATN in EXata 5.1 for simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is appropriate for M-info collection in the SD-ATN. © 2018 Kefan Chen et al.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: K.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.  © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 54; Correspondence Address: H.

Multi-UAV System of Systems (SoS) have proliferated due to their abilities to work autonomously, to decentralize mission workload and to exhibit resiliency in the ability to retain mission functionality even if a UAV node or network connectivity is lost. This resiliency is not inherent, and must be architected into both the SoS and UAV node/payload, especially in the areas of communications, control, ad-hoc networking, and path planning. As an exemplar, the Resilient System Engineering (RSE) process will be used to derive and identify resilience attributes for a Multi-UAV SoS architecture. For this paper, the Multi-UAV SoS will be tasked for Search and Rescue (SAR) and use a Time/Frequency Difference of Arrival (T/FDOA) based location algorithm to locate agents in distress. A simulation of the SAR SoS, using Contract-Based Design (CBD) invariant contracts are used to quantify the intended resilience/emergence attributes of the Multi-UAV SAR SoS and the T/FDOA location approach. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: E.B.

Since the GCS belongs to the central control architecture, the edge computing system of the distributed architecture gives the drones more flexibility in dealing with changing environmental conditions, allowing them to autonomously and instantly plan their flight path, fly in formation, or even avoid obstacles. Broadcast communications are used to realize UAV-to-UAV communications for allocating tasks among a swarm of UAVs and ensuring each individual collaborates as an integrated member of the group. The dynamic path programming problem for the UAV swarm mission uses a 2-phase Tabu search with the 2-Opt exchange method and A∗ search as the path programming algorithm. Distance is taken as a cost function for path programming. We then increase and expand the turning-points of no-fly zones based on drone fleet coverage, thus preventing drones from entering prohibited areas. Whereas previous work mostly only considers single no-fly zones, this approach accounts for multiple restricted areas, ensuring that a UAV swarm can complete its assigned task without violating no-fly zones. A drone encountering an obstacle while traveling along the route set by the algorithm will update the map information in real-time, allowing for an instant recharting of the optimal path to the goal as a reverse search using the D∗ Lite algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 3rd IEEE Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering, ECICE 2021; Conference date: 29 October 2021 through 31 October 2021; Conference code: 175835</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124249276&amp;doi=10.1109%2fECICE52819.2021.9645660&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dc891032b6f8fd6b7d7da0490cc522f6</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc.

VaMEx, abbreviation for Valles Marineris Explorer, is an example of such an initiative. VaMEx aims to survey the canyons of the Valles Marineris valley, which spans approximately 4000 km from East to West and 7 km in depth near the Martian equator, for the duration of one year. VaMEx comprises of a swarm of multiple robotic elements: crawler robots, surface mobility rovers and aerial mobility vehicles. These users are foreseen to disperse along the Valles Marineris independently while pursuing their collaborative exploration tasks. Due to the hazardous environment, it is required that these elements navigate autonomously, broadcast position information and exchange science data during the operational phase of the mission. To support these functions, a VaMEx space segment to be located in a Mars orbit(s) is being proposed. This space segment is called the VaMEx NavComNet (Navigation and Communication Network). The NavComNet has the concrete aims of serving as a near real-time positioning system for surface, aerial and potential space-based users; serving as a science data, telemetry and telecommand relay between Earth and the in-situ users; as well as cross-communication relay between users. In order to develop a suitable concept for the VaMEx NavComNet, three possible swarm localization schemes was investigated: 1) radio positioning, 2) cartographic triangulation of ground features from optical images and 3) cartographic triangulation of radar persistent scatters. The first method, radio positioning, relies on range and Doppler shift observables of an RF signal transmitted between provider-user. A good example of such architecture are widely used Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The second method involves the detection and tracking of swarm elements by comparing topographic characteristics extracted from optical images. The third concept involves synthetic aperture radar imaging (SAR), whereby interactions with the impinging radar signal can be detected and used to triangulate the user's location. For each of the proposed navigation concepts, an optimum orbit constellation solution was assessed. Each solution was evaluated in terms of orbit stability, control effort and communications performance using metrics specific to each of the three concepts (length of pass, visibility gaps, geometry constraints, etc.). With the described navigation concept and mission analysis results, a preliminary operational architecture for the VaMEx NavComNet space segment is conceived, taking into account existing technologies, communications performance, overall mission complexity and feasibility.

The parallel computing architecture takes advantages of maintaining better population diversity and inhibiting premature convergence in comparison with conventional PSOs. The collision-free discontinuous path generated from the PPSO planner is then smoothed using the cubic B-spline and system-on-a-programmable-chip (SoPC) technology.

These bodies may also one day serve as resource restocking de-pots for longer duration missions. However, in-situ scientific analysis requires the development of microgravity-tolerant landers that are not subject to recoil on impact. Whereas prior art focuses primarily on anchoring and hopping mechanisms, this paper evaluates a novel mission architecture in which chains of bistable pinching elements called grapplers are used to land net-like infrastructure on low gravity bodies. Unlike single-point-of-contact landers, a net that is successfully adhered to an asteroid may serve broad and flexible use in the exploration of small bodies. For example, it may constitute infrastructure to enable locomotion of a swarm of distributed crawling sensors and actuators for high resolution study of the body’s interior structure and surface properties. It may also serve as a foundation onto which larger scale sensing and communication structures can be built over time. Finally, it may serve as a series of hand holds used by astronauts to maneuver around the body. To adhere the net to a body, microgravity flight testing of a representative Grappler prototype demonstrates the tolerance of a bistable chain to variable impact conditions and terrain contours owing to the inherent adaptivity of the chain’s pinching configuration-for a chain of n bistable elements, 2n pinching configurations are possible. These pinching elements can be integrated sparsely or densely into net-like infrastructure. A computational model is also presented. Grapplers are compared to alternative net adhesion strategies ranging from passive wrapping to chemical rigidization. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The communication among the swarm of robots influences the overall performance in terms of time to execute the task or consumed energy. To address this problem, a new distributed recruiting protocol to coordinate a swarm of robots in demining mission, is described. This problem is a multi-objective problem and two bio inspired strategies are used. The novelty of this approach lies in the combination of direct and indirect communication: on one hand an indirect communication among robots is used for the exploration of the environment, on the other hand a novel protocol is used to accomplish the recruiting and coordination of the robots for demining task. This protocol attempts to tackle the question of how autonomous robot can coordinate themselves into an unknown environment relying on simple low-level capabilities. The strategy is able to adapt the current system dynamics if the number of robots or the environment structure or both change. The proposed approach has been implemented and has been evaluated in several simulated environments. We analyzed the impact of our approach in the overall performance of a robot team. Experimental results indicated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed protocol to spread the robots in the environment. © 2016 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Conference name: Unmanned Systems Technology XVIII; Conference date: 20 April 2016 through 21 April 2016; Conference code: 123547; CODEN: PSISD</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987849523&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.2228859&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b7dc1bfb4058776120a56ca5c787c3fa</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, C.</author><author>Zhang, K.</author><author>Jiang, Y.</author><author>Niu, S.</author><author>Yang, T.</author><author>Song, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication aware uav swarm surveillance based on hierarchical architecture</title><secondary-title>Drones</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drones</full-title><abbr-1>Drones</abbr-1></periodical><volume>5</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Communication aware UAV formation</keyword><keyword>Dynamical object tracking</keyword><keyword>Hierarchical architecture of UAV teaming</keyword><keyword>Intercommunication quality</keyword><keyword>Persistent surveillance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2504446X (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/drones5020033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Multi-agent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teaming becomes an essential part in science mission, modern warfare surveillance, and disaster rescuing. This paper proposes a decentralized UAV swarm persistent monitoring strategy in realizing continuous sensing coverage and network service. A two-layer (high altitude and low altitude) UAV teaming hierarchical structure is adopted in realizing the accurate object tracking in the area of interest (AOI). By introducing the UAV communication channel model in its path planning, both centralized and decentralized control schemes would be evaluated in the waypoint tracking simulation. The UAV swarm network service and object tracking are measured by metrics of communication link quality and waypoints tracking accuracy. UAV swarm network connectivity are evaluated over different aspects, such as stability and volatility. The comparison of proposed algorithms is presented with simulations. The result shows that the decentralized scheme outperforms the centralized scheme in the mission of persistent surveillance, especially on maintaining the stability of inner UAV swarm network while tracking moving objects. © 2021 by the authors.

With 5G New Radio (5G NR), UAS swarm networking can yield high capacities of mobile communication to provide more stable, effective services for UAS swarm. However, the conventional architectures of UAS swarm networking are centralized and hierarchical, thus restricting the high volume communication due to heterogeneous swarm communication, and the deployment of UAS swarms on a large scale. In this paper, inspired by the behavior of cell communication, we propose a cell wall oriented bi-Throughput optimization algorithm for UAS swarm networking. To be specific, We leverage edge-coloring to optimize the routing schedule to obtain the maximum throughput for each UAS swarm. The evaluation shows that the throughput from both directions can be enhanced to achieve an improvement of up to 90% when the time slot is less than 0. 01s. The 5G-enabled optimal bi-Throughput solution shows great potential to provide UAS swarm networking more compatible capacities for the challenging mission in real-Time. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Conference name: 1st International Conference on Space-Air-Ground Computing, SAGC 2020; Conference date: 4 December 2020 through 6 December 2020; Conference code: 168562</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105422181&amp;doi=10.1109%2fSAGC50777.2020.00019&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2f104ea9d59223f982930e2f80b78a9e</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc. - Int.

The integrated simulator exploits some already existing tools to simulate a specific part of the overall Unmanned aerial vehicle hardware and software structure: a 3D visualization engine, a physics simulator, a flight control stack and a network simulator to handle communications among Unmanned aerial vehicles. These features are provided by the tools Gazebo, ArduCopterand ns-3 that, however, are not designed to work together in an integrated manner. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a software middleware that coordinates all of these tools, which may optionally be run on multiple interconnected computers, and lets them have a common notion of simulated time during the simulation; moreover, the middleware coordinates the activities of the High-level Logic, which is the software part that implements the strategy and control of the multi Unmanned aerial vehicle application. A Python API is provided to allow developers to write their Unmanned aerial vehicle application (cooperative missions, flocking, etc.) in such a way as to be first simulated and then run onto the real platform with no or few modifications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: F.F.

In parallel, several applications are being envisioned that bring together a swarm of multiple networked micro air vehicles to accomplish large tasks in coordination. However, it is still very challenging to deploy multiple micro air vehicles concurrently. To address this challenge, we have developed an open software/hardware platform called the University at Buffalo’s Airborne Networking and Communications Testbed (UB-ANC), and an associated emulation framework called the UB-ANC Emulator. In this paper, we present the UB-ANC Emulator, which combines multi-micro air vehicle planning and control with high-fidelity network simulation, enables practitioners to design micro air vehicle swarm applications in software and provides seamless transition to deployment on actual hardware. We demonstrate the UB-ANC Emulator’s accuracy against experimental data collected in two mission scenarios: a simple mission with three networked micro air vehicles and a sophisticated coverage path planning mission with a single micro air vehicle. To accurately reflect the performance of a micro air vehicle swarm where communication links are subject to interference and packet losses, and protocols at the data link, network, and transport layers affect network throughput, latency, and reliability, we integrate the open-source discrete-event network simulator ns-3 into the UB-ANC Emulator. We demonstrate through node-to-node and end-to-end measurements how the UB-ANC Emulator can be used to simulate multiple networked micro air vehicles with accurate modeling of mobility, control, wireless channel characteristics, and network protocols defined in ns-3. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: N.

Nowadays the Precise Orbit Determination (POD) is the technique routinely used on ground for computing the orbit of LEO missions, especially when the position of the satellite center of mass has to be known at cm level (e.g.: GRAS, Sentinels, SWARM, GOCE, etc.). The current POD approach must be performed only on ground in post-processing. The orbit accuracy achieved with the POD is typically between 0.1 mm/s to 1 mm/s for the velocity. Despite being in line with mission needs, the post-processing limitation is preventing its use for more advanced applications that require high accuracy in real-time, such as formation flying, autonomous docking and rendezvous, increased spacecraft autonomy, etc. This contribution investigates how to overcome the real-time limitations and shows that real-time Precise Onboard Orbit Determination (P2OD) could be achieved in the near future, bringing the current ground PPP (Precise Point Positioning) and PPP-RTK (Precise Point Positioning -Real Time Kinematic) concept to space users. The target real-time orbit accuracy to be achieved with this approach is 10 cm RMS 3D (1 mm/s for velocity). Different algorithms have already been developed for onboard orbit determination, ranging from a least square approach to Extended or Unscented Kalman Filtering (EKF, UKF). Usually the initial position is provided through a Single Point Positioning (SPP) technique, using only the pseudorange measurements. The SPP solution can be smoothed by fitting a dynamic model. These onboard algorithms allow to reach an orbital velocity accuracy (3D RMS) at m/s or cm/s level ([23], [24], [25], [26] and [27]). Several studies ([28], [29] and [30]) have also investigated the optimization of the force models acting on the satellites and the related parameters for propagating the orbit with the electronics onboard a LEO satellite. The main limitation for such onboard OD algorithms is the lack of precise ephemeris and clock products for the GNSS satellites in real-time. GNSS receivers in space can use techniques and concepts adoptable by GNSS receiver on ground. There are at least two main concepts for real-time high accuracy positioning computation based on GNSS: RTK and PPP. RTK relies on use of ground stations in the proximity of the user receiver, therefore cannot be considered viable from space users. PPP (and its evolution, the PPP-RTK) is based on the broadcast of precise corrections (mainly precise orbits and clocks, but also a precise ionospheric model and, for PPP-RTK, delta phase correction for performing Integer Ambiguity Resolution on the rover) through different communication channels (e.g., via geostationary satellites, GSM, Internet). This study addresses two main types of communication channels for providing precise orbit and clock corrections of the GNSS satellites: the dedicated broadcast and the global broadcast channels. The dedicated broadcast channel assumes that each GNSS satellite (e.g.: GPS or Galileo) broadcasts its own precise corrections for orbits and clocks. Such a condition could be achieved with an improvement of the current broadcasted ephemerides and clocks (via standard navigation message) or via a dedicated communication channel provided by the GNSS satellites that goes on top of the broadcasted navigation message. In this scenario the available bandwidth is normally limited, so the amount of corrections that can be disseminated is limited (allowing to transmit only the corrections for the satellite itself or a small group of nearby satellites) and there is a need for a constant communication contact from the uplink stations to all or a high number of the GNSS satellites. Modern GNSS systems are very close to provide the infrastructure to enable the dedicated broadcast scheme and the present study aims to propose potential strategies to overcome the current limitations. The global broadcast channel relies on geostationary satellites for disseminating the precise corrections for all the GNSS satellites at the same time. Two major cases are considered: SBAS and commercial PPP providers. SBAS is planned to achieve worldwide coverage by 2020, but the dissemination of precise corrections to achieve cm level accuracy is today outside the scope of such systems, mainly because providing the integrity for such an accuracy might be not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, a new service providing high accuracy corrections (initially without integrity) could be implemented using a potentially available spare bandwidth in the SBAS. Nowadays, commercial geostationary satellites are the only way to achieve the dissemination of precise corrections, using commercial PPP service providers that currently cover the entire globe. This work will analyze the implications of using such communication channels on the space receiver architecture. The adopted solution will be suitable for different types of 24h 3-axis stabilized LEO spacecraft, from nano-satellites to large Earth-observing satellites. A novel concept based on the use of multi-antennas will be proposed to overcome the weak communication links above the poles for receiving the corrections from geostationary satellites. The real-time precise orbit determination will be sequentially computed with an EKF-based OD algorithm. The approach will be validated using real data from flying missions. Finally, a potential roadmap for In-Orbit Demonstration (IOD) will be presented. © 2017 Institute of Navigation.

As a new form of flying things, they can access the network for better communication via the aerial base station. Most of the Unmanned aerial vehicles assisted flying objects' optimal path selection schemes does not consider the path deviation. In path deviation attacks, secure data transmission are not addressed in existing works. The secure communication process between Unmanned aerial vehicles and base station are exploited through security-based attacks. Moreover, path loss issue leads to multicast packet loss and unsecured broadcast. The existing network architecture setup does not fulfill the secure data communication and privacy issues. In this paper, Blockchain is utilized to investigate the secure communication between Unmanned aerial vehicles to Wireless Unmanned aerial vehicles Base stations. Since the destination information is dynamic under an uncertain environment, it will cause a delay in data communication. Unmanned aerial vehicles are more vulnerable to security attacks. The proposed blockchain-based architecture supports secure data communication in Unmanned aerial vehicles uncertain environments.

Each robot may have homogeneous or heterogeneous capabilities and can be programmed with several fundamental control laws adapting to the environment. Through different kinds of relationships built using the communication protocols, they present various behaviors based on the shared information and current state. To adapt to dynamic environments effectively, and maximize the utility of the group, robots need to cooperate, share their local information, and make a suitable plan according to the specific scenario. In this paper, we formalize the problem of multi-robots fulfilling dynamic tasks using state transitions represented through a Behavior Tree. We design a framework with corresponding distributed algorithms for communications between robots and negotiation and agreement protocols through a novel priority mechanism. Finally, we evaluate our framework through simulation experiments. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Conference name: 2nd International Symposium on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems, MRS 2019; Conference date: 22 August 2019 through 23 August 2019; Conference code: 154450</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075635718&amp;doi=10.1109%2fMRS.2019.8901075&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6ed512416419e0546cebf97a47dac25c</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Int.

In particular, since it preys on honey bees, its recent progression in Europe could soon pose a significant risk to the local apiculture activity. European beekeepers are therefore investigating adapted control strategies, including V. velutina nest destruction. Unfortunately, nest location pinpointing generally follows a manual process which can prove tedious, time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose the use of a network of micro aerial vehicles featuring autonomous and cooperative flight capabilities. We describe an adapted controlled mobility strategy and detail the design of our Virtual Force Protocol (VFP) which allows a swarm of vehicles to track and follow hornets to their nests, while maintaining connectivity through a wireless multi-hop communication route with a remote ground station used to store applicative data such as hornet trajectory and vehicle telemetry. In order to achieve the mission objectives with a minimum of vehicles, we identify through simulations appropriate value for the key parameters of VFP and discuss the obtained network performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: L.

The nonlinear dynamic system bifurcation theory together with artificial potential field (APF) method is applied. Artificial control force field is designed so that the system has desired bifurcation and stability characteristics to achieve different formation configurations or formation reconfiguration. Static bifurcating artificial potential fields is designed by using hyperbolic-exponential function to accomplish different static formations. The stability of the formation is verified through theoretical proof using Lyapunov method and local linearization method. In addition, the linear coordinate transformation and redefining of the relative position vector are introduced to generate nonspherically symmetrical potential field so as to realize formation distortion and some non-uniform formations. Different cases of formation flying of swarm with 30 spacecraft are simulated. Numerical results show that the proposed method can achieve many different formation configurations, such as single circle and ellipse, double concentric circle and ellipse, disc elliptical disc, diamond and etc. Each spacecraft moves cooperatively with all the other spacecraft "naturally", without direct communication between each other and any extra external orders or centralized planning and control. The presented method to form the swarm configuration diversity, is of great significance for future engineering practice. Copyright © 2017 by International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Intelligent swarm systems are very efficient at solving group-level problems and their capability to accomplish complex missions with no or little human intervention. One of the most challenging problems is operating in environments with surrounding obstacles such as buildings, thus, often obstructing inter-UAV communication. A UAV swarm is required to maintain continuous communication between its members and preserve the stability of its formation while flying towards an ultimate goal. In this paper we propose MSCS, a new cooperative and adaptive scheme for multi-clustered autonomous UAV swarms. This schemes allows several UAVs operating in a swarm formation to coordinate their navigation and path planning operations by using an adaptive multi-clustered leader-follower approach. The swarm members follow a dynamically elected leader based on the UAV with best fit to lead the swarm towards the destination. The coordination of the UAVs is achieved through SBP (Swarm Broadcast Protocol), a single-hop broadcast UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication protocol, which allows swarm members to exchange information about their current location and their local cluster leader. We present a set of performance results, which show that this scheme contributes efficiently at maintaining the swarm formation's stability at acceptable density and disconnection ratio. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9; Conference name: 16th IEEE&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2020; Conference date: 15 June 2020 through 19 June 2020; Conference code: 162085</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089706012&amp;doi=10.1109%2fIWCMC48107.2020.9148449&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=982eda5c280567c74dba5360c073b41a</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Int.

UAVs are increasingly appearing in the form of swarms or formations to meet higher mission requirements. Communication plays an important role in UAV swarm control and coordination. The communication architecture defines how information is exchanged between UAVs or between UAVs and the central control center. Routing protocols help provide reliable end-to-end data transmission. Therefore, it is particularly important to design UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols with high performance and stability. This review article details four communication architectures including the advantages and disadvantages. Applicable scenarios are also discussed. In addition, a systematic overview and feasibility research of routing protocols are presented in this paper. To spur further research, the open research issues of UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols are also investigated. © 2020 by the authors.

OLFAR (Orbiting Low Frequency Array for Radio astronomy) is one such mission where 10 to 50+ nanosatellites are placed in the Lunar orbit and perform astronomical observations from the far-side of the moon. Each of the nanosatellite in the swarm would carry a receiver that performs observations between 0.3 - 30 MHz, which are the least explored frequency bands in radio astronomy, thus attracting a large scientific interest. Observations in this frequency bands from Earth are highly challenging as the ionosphere is opaque to these frequency bands. Furthermore, RFI (Radio Frequency Interferences) generated on Earth makes it highly challenging to perform astronomical observations below 30MHz band. The impediments faced by Earth-based or near-Earth-based radio astronomy for these frequency bands is the motivation to perform measurements from the far-side of the moon. The purpose of using a swarm of nanosatellites to perform low frequency observations is to enable the realization of long observation baselines and additionally, the effective aperture of observation increases with the number of satellites. For the swarm of nanosatellites to operate as a single aperture, it is very important to cross-correlate the information collected by each satellite and this is where the ISL becomes very crucial. Apart from exchanging data collected by the payload, other information such as attitude and timing information needs to be exchanged. This work derived mission level requirements which would be used to define a suitable communication architecture for space-based radio astronomy missions such as OLFAR. The approach chosen for communication system for such a swarm mission will comprise of two types of ISL: High data-rate directional link that will be used to exchange payload date and low data-rate omni-directional link that will be used to exchange attitude, timing information and be used for localization, positioning and ranging of the nanosatellites in the swarm. This work will present link budgets to show the feasibility of the proposed communication architecture and derive the specs to further design the transceivers.

Focusing on this topic, the mechanisms for modeling and coordinating tasks are deeply studied in this article. After analyzing typical features of task cooperation, a hierarchical architecture of task models is firstly proposed and established, where mission, sub-mission and atom task models are designed, from the top-level to the bottom. Meanwhile, a policy-based parsing mechanism is proposed to autonomously decompose a mission into a set of atom tasks with special constraints. On this basis, resource related entities for various atom tasks are designed uniformly, and for the purpose of behavior synchronization, the concept of virtual logic task is further introduced and Topic-based communication channel is adopted over DDS middleware. Finally, a typical example is given and analyzed. In general, this work provides a feasible idea and method for constructing cooperative swarm intelligent systems.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.

Autonomy is a critical need for these systems, since the cost associated with applying conventional approaches for command and control does not scale with the number of spacecraft. Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy (DSA) is a project developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that enables distributed spacecraft systems through the development of three capabilities: scalable communication, distributed coordination and planning, and human-swarm interaction. DSA will demonstrate these capabilities in two contexts. The first context is a flight demonstration consisting of a software payload hosted on the Starling-1 small-spacecraft mission. This software payload will use the on-board GPS receiver to perform in-situ, swarm-level reconfiguration in response to observed features in the Topside Ionosphere. The second context is a scalability study, which shows how the technologies developed in the flight demonstration can scale to a large number of spacecraft (≈ 100). The scalability demonstration applies the tools developed for the flight mission to a hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the flight software payload. © 2020 The MITRE Corporation.

As this technology develops and is deployed for missions in Low Earth Orbit and beyond, the use of delay tolerant networking (DTN) techniques may improve communication capabilities within the network. In this paper, a network hierarchy is developed from heterogeneous networks of SmallSats, surface vehicles, relay satellites and ground stations which form an integrated network. There is a trade-off between complexity, flexibility, and scalability of user defined schedules versus autonomous routing as the number of nodes in the network increases. To address these issues, this work proposes a machine learning classifier based on DTN routing metrics. A framework is developed which will allow for the use of several categories of machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest, and deep learning) to be applied to a dataset of historical network statistics, which allows for the evaluation of algorithm complexity versus performance to be explored. We develop the emulation of a hierarchical network, consisting of tens of nodes which form a cognitive network architecture. CORE (Common Open Research Emulator) is used to emulate the network using bundle protocol and DTN IP neighbor discovery. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 2019 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2019; Conference date: 25 June 2019 through 26 June 2019; Conference code: 155025</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075926912&amp;doi=10.1109%2fCCAAW.2019.8904898&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e661b391308cd92edb6e07b4ee14dde6</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Cogn.

Mixed-reality simulations where both virtual and physical entities can coexist and interact have been shown to be beneficial for development, testing, and verification of such systems. This paper deals with the problems of designing a certain communication subsystem for such highly desirable realistic simulations. Requirements of this communication subsystem, including proper addressing, transparent routing, visibility modeling, or message management, are specified prior to designing an appropriate solution. Then, a suitable architecture of this communication subsystem is proposed together with solutions to the challenges that arise when simultaneous virtual and physical message transmissions occur. The proposed architecture can be utilized as a high-fidelity network simulator for vehicular systems with implicit mobility models that are given by real trajectories of the vehicles. The architecture has been utilized within multiple projects dealing with the development and practical deployment of multi-UAV systems, which support the architecture’s viability and advantages. The provided experimental results show the achieved similarity of the communication characteristics of the fully deployed hardware setup to the setup utilizing the proposed mixed-reality architecture. © 2018 by the authors.

This research paper aims to perform multidisciplinary design and optimization for an expendable microsatellite launch vehicle (MSLV) comprising three solid-propellant stages, capable of delivering micro-payloads in the low earth orbit. The methodology’s primary purpose is to increase the conceptual and preliminary design process’s efficiency by reducing both the design and development costs. Design/methodology/approach: Multidiscipline feasible architecture is applied for the multidisciplinary design and optimization of an expendable MSLV at the conceptual level to accommodate interdisciplinary interactions during the optimization process. The multidisciplinary design and optimization framework developed and implemented in this research effort encompasses coupled analysis disciplines of vehicle geometry, mass calculations, aerodynamics, propulsion and trajectory. Nineteen design variables were selected to optimize expendable MSLV to launch a 100 kg satellite at an altitude of 600 km in the low earth orbit. Modern heuristic optimization methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SA are applied and compared to obtain the optimal configurations. The initial population is created by passing the upper and lower bounds of design variables to the optimizer. The optimizer then searches for the best possible combination of design variables to obtain the objective function while satisfying the constraints. Findings: All of the applied heuristic methods were able to optimize the design problem. Optimized design variables from these methods lie within the lower and upper bounds. This research successfully achieves the desired altitude and final injection velocity while satisfying all the constraints. In this research effort, multiple runs of heuristic algorithms reduce the fundamental stochastic error. Research limitations/implications: The use of multiple heuristics optimization methods such as GA, PSO and SA in the conceptual design phase owing to the exclusivity of their search approach provides a unique opportunity for exploration of the feasible design space and helps in obtaining alternative configurations capable of meeting the mission objectives, which is not possible when using any of the single optimization algorithm. Practical implications: The optimized configurations can be further used as baseline configurations in the microsatellite launch missions’ conceptual and preliminary design phases. Originality/value: Satellite launch vehicle design and optimization is a complex multidisciplinary problem, and it is dealt with effectively in the multidisciplinary design and optimization domain. It integrates several interlinked disciplines and gives the optimum result that satisfies these disciplines’ requirements. This research effort provides the multidisciplinary design and optimization-based simulation framework to predict and evaluate various expendable satellite launch vehicle configurations’ performance. This framework significantly increases the conceptual and preliminary design process’s efficiency by reducing design and development costs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: A.F.

Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9; Conference name: 2019 Winter Simulation Conference, WSC 2019; Conference date: 8 December 2019 through 11 December 2019; Conference code: 157944; CODEN: WSCPD</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081125582&amp;doi=10.1109%2fWSC40007.2019.9004907&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=85bcd81a992eea2e2b1dc2fc22e27af2</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc.

This article presents a toolset that can perform an over-the-air code update of the robots in a swarm while the swarm is active, without interrupting the swarm's mission. Each update is generated as a patch of the currently deployed code. A consensus mechanism borrowed from swarm intelligence ensures that, at any given time, all robots in the swarm run the same code version. Simulations were conducted with thousands of units to study the scalability and bandwidth consumption of the update process. Real deployment experiments were then performed on a small swarm of commercial quadcopters.

In the event of fire, mine collapse or disasters like earthquake, swarm of robots can enter the area, conduct rescue operations, collect images and convey locations of interest to the rescue team and enable them to plan their approach in advance. Task allocation among members of the swarm is a critical and challenging problem to be addressed. DTTA- a distributed, Time-division multiple access (TDMA) based task allocation framework is proposed for swarm of robots which can be utilised to solve any of the 8 different types of task allocation problem identified by Gerkey and Mataric'. DTTA is reactive and supports task migration via extended task assignments to complete the mission in case of failure of the assigned robot to complete the task. DTTA can be utilised for any kind of robot in land or for co-operative systems comprising of land robots and air-borne drones. Dependencies with other layers of the protocol stack were identified and a quantitative analysis of communication and computational complexity is provided. To our knowledge this is the first work to be reported on task allocation for clustered scalable networks suitable for handling all 8 types of multi-robot task allocation problem. Effectiveness and feasibility of deploying DTTA in real world scenarios is demonstrated by testing the framework for two diverse application scenarios. © 2017, DESIDOC.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; CODEN: DSJOA</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018346851&amp;doi=10.14429%2fdsj.67.10995&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=643b03ed565ee009ad3fa12db6c4df11</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chelmins, D.</author><author>Briones, J.</author><author>Downey, J.</author><author>Clark, G.</author><author>Gannon, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive communications for NASA space systems</title><secondary-title>IET Conference Publications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IET Conf Publ</full-title></periodical><volume>2019</volume><keywords><keyword>Information management</keyword><keyword>Complex networks</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Autonomy</keyword><keyword>Cost effectiveness</keyword><keyword>Data transfer</keyword><keyword>Digital storage</keyword><keyword>Cognitive systems</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>NASA</keyword><keyword>Communication satellites</keyword><keyword>Cognitive</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Space flight</keyword><keyword>MESH networking</keyword><keyword>Inter-spacecraft communication</keyword><keyword>Spacecraft constellations</keyword><keyword>Artificial intelligence agent</keyword><keyword>Autonomous communication systems</keyword><keyword>Calcium compounds</keyword><keyword>Cognitive communications</keyword><keyword>Commercial communication</keyword><keyword>Communication complexity</keyword><keyword>Delay-tolerant networking</keyword><keyword>Service provider networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institution of Engineering and Technology</publisher><isbn>978-183953499-7 (ISBN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1049/cp.2019.1222</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The growing complexity of spacecraft constellations, communication relay offerings, and mission architectures drives the need for the development of autonomous communication systems. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has traditionally launched single spacecraft missions that are served by the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) program. Operations on SCaN networks are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and often each asset serves a single user spacecraft at a time. Recent movement towards swarm missions could make the current approach unsustainable. Additionally, the integration of commercial communication service providers will substantially increase the data transfer options available to new missions. NASA science missions have found benefit in launching swarms of spacecraft, allowing coordinated simultaneous observations from different perspectives. Inter-spacecraft communication (mesh networking) is an enabler for this architecture, as are CubeSats that allow cost-effective provisioning of distributed mission assets. As more complex swarm missions launch, one challenge is coordinating communication within the swarm and choosing the appropriate mechanism for telemetry, tracking, control, and data services to and from Earth. Cognitive communications research conducted by SCaN aims to mitigate the increasing communication complexity for mission users by increasing the autonomy of links, networks, and service scheduling. By considering automation techniques including recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, cognitive algorithms and related approaches enable increased mission science return, improved resource utilization for service provider networks, and resiliency in unpredictable or unplanned environments. The Cognitive Communications Project at the NASA Glenn Research Center develops applications of data-driven, nondeterministic methods to improve the autonomy of space communication. The project emphasizes the development of decentralized space networks with artificial intelligence agents optimizing communication link throughput, data routing, and system-wide asset management. This chapter discusses the objectives, approaches, and opportunities of the research to address growing needs of the space communications community. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The new developments extend the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's CARACaS (Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing) autonomy architecture, which provides foundational software infrastructure, core executive functions, and several default robotic technology modules. In Swarm II, CARACaS demonstrated higher levels of autonomy and more complex cooperation than previous on-water exercises, using full-sized vehicles and real-world sensing and communication. The core autonomous behaviors to support the harbor patrol scenario included Patrol, Track, Inspect, and Trail, providing the capability of finding all vessels entering the patrol area, keeping track of them, inspecting them to infer intent, and trailing suspect vessels. Significantly, CARACaS assumed responsibility for not only executing tasks safely and efficiently but also recognizing what tasks needed to be accomplished, given the current state of the world. Since the heterogeneous USV teams shared world model that evolved, such as due to (dis) appearance of vessels in the area or a change in health or availability of a USV, CARACaS replanned to generate and reallocate the new task list. Thus, human intervention was never required in the loop to task USVs during mission execution, though a supervisory role was supported in the autonomy system for mission monitoring and exception handling. Finally, CARACaS also ensured the USVs avoided hazards and obeyed the applicable rules of the road, using its local motion planning modules. © 2017 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Conference name: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017; Conference date: 11 April 2017 through 13 April 2017; Conference code: 128631; CODEN: PSISD</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025166518&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.2262067&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e6eccd9ece661f2356e6491b6c916f43</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carpentiero, M.</author><author>Sabatini, M.</author><author>Palmerini, G.B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication and navigation architecture for planetary exploration carried-on by a swarm of mobile robots</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proc.

Continuous evolution in robotics technologies, including improvement in sensors, in miniaturization, in software engineering allows to focus on the concept of unmanned, autonomous exploration carried on by swarm of mobile robots. As taught by several biology's examples, the cooperation among smaller, simpler agents provide effectiveness and ensures a good return even in case of the loss of some - or several - robots. This cooperation is primarily based on the exchange among the swarm's agents of information including payload data and positioning insight. A simple (to keep expandable platforms and their subsystems at a reasonable level in cost and complexity), yet effective communication and navigation architecture is requested to perform the task. The paper is part of a project aiming to first analyse the requirements for this architecture at the general level, and then investigate possible solutions by means of numerical simulations performed with purposely prepared software codes. Performance clearly depends on the mission environment, and in such a concern swarms composed by rovers, drones or low-altitude flying platforms have to be considered, include peculiar motion constraints and issues. Simulations consider radiofrequency links in different bands, with preliminary modelling of the channels' characteristics. Obstacles and outages, breaking the connections, are modelled. A specific attention is devoted to the navigation, in order to assess the nature and amount of data required to provide either a relative or absolute positioning capability: this information is crucial for referencing the data collected by the payload as well as for the coordinated guidance of the swarm. Being robustness the crucial asset of the swarm concept, the performance in different mission scenarios are evaluated on the basis of both deterministic and non-deterministic failures. Previous hands-on experience gained from studies and experiments devoted to small fleets of rovers operating in terrestrial, hostile environment is an important input for this research. As a result, a software code in MATLAB has been prepared and tested in order to be able, during next step of the project, to simulate in details the behaviour of fleets ranging from 2 to tens of agents operating in different scenarios of interest for planetary exploration. In this software code, the communications behaviour enters by limiting the mutual availability of information to the different agents (outages due to interposed obstacles) or out-of-range relative positioning. Navigation instead comes with the uncertainty in the knowledge of the kinematic state. These missing data affect the guidance computation and indeed limit the effectiveness of the exploration itself. © 2018 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

Design of such systems requires knowledge of the flight dynamics of UAVs and the communication links connecting UAVs with each other or with the ground control station. Besides, UAV networks are dynamic and distinctive from other ad-hoc networks and require protocols that can adapt to high-mobility, dynamic topology and changing link quality in power constrained resource platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to co-design the UAV path planning algorithms and the communication protocols. The proposed co-simulation framework integrates existing tools to simulate flight dynamics and network related aspects. Gazebo with robot operating system (ROS) is used as a physical system UAV simulator and NS-3 is used as a network simulator, to jointly capture the cyber-physical system (CPS) aspects of the multi-UAV systems. A particular aspect we address is on synchronizing time and position across the two simulation environments, and we provide APIs to allow easy migration of the algorithms to real platforms. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Conference name: 2020 International Conference on COMmunication Systems and NETworkS, COMSNETS 2020; Conference date: 7 January 2020 through 11 January 2020; Conference code: 158297</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082169989&amp;doi=10.1109%2fCOMSNETS48256.2020.9027459&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=98180782361cbb06979fa7c8e0ad1a3f</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Int.

Communication bandwidth is extremely limited in the underwater domain, hence it is crucial to efficiently manage and distribute this scarce resource between nodes. This paper discusses a symmetric, distributed time-slotted channel access algorithm for large-scale, dynamic ad-hoc networks. In contrast to traditional network algorithms which are mostly designed for sporadic point-to-point communication, this algorithm specifically optimises fast, continuous information distribution, locally and globally, while achieving close to 100% channel utilisation. A theoretical analysis of the performance is presented, along with real-time simulation results for dozens of nodes performing rapid reconfigurations. The impact of swarm dynamics on network performance is analysed in detail. © IFAC.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Conference name: 9th IFAC Conference on Manoeuvring and Control of Marine Craft, MCMC 2012; Conference date: 19 September 2012 through 21 September 2012; Conference code: 105079</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84900512922&amp;doi=10.3182%2f20120919-3-IT-2046.00017&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f7e7992b25accf05f856d215df3980cb</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IFAC Proc.

In this scenario, Cooperative Multi-Robot / Multi-Sensor systems represent a new generation of ICT systems [1] [2], where mobile physical agents, equipped with sensors and/or actuators, may replace human operators in performing tasks in hazardous or risky environments. In this context the Center for TeleInFrastruktur (CTIF) Italy, with its headquarter at University of Rome "Tor Vergata", and the Italian company Space Software Italia (SSI), have realized a device that allows to mobile physical agents to perform operations within a spatial-temporal area defined by mission data. Such a device is enough small to be easily integrated within physical agents. Moreover, changing not so much software and no modifying hardware, we have implemented several functions. The system is geo-referenced since it foresees a GPS receiver assembled in the device that communicates with a microcontroller. A demo has been developed by us in order to simulate a geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system. The paper aims at showing the geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system architecture together with the development issues.

Such networks can be very useful in practice in applications that require fine-grain monitoring of physical environment subjected to critical conditions (such as inaccessible terrains or disaster places). Features including the huge number of sensor devices involved, the severe power, computational and memory limitations, their dense deployment and frequent failures, pose new design and implementation aspects. The efficient and robust realization of such large, highly-dynamic, complex, non-conventional, environments is a challenging algorithmic task. We here present the Forward Planning Situated Protocol (FPSP), for scalable, energy efficient and fault tolerant data propagation in situated wireless sensor networks. To deal with the increased complexity of such deeply networked sensor systems, instead of emphasizing on a particular aspect of the services provided, i.e. either for low-energy periodic, or low-latency event-driven, or high-success query-based sensing, FPSP uses two novel mechanisms that allow the network operator to adjust the performance of the protocol in terms of energy, latency and success rate on a per-task basis. We emphasize on distributedness, direct or indirect interactions among relatively simple agents, flexibility and robustness. The protocol operates by employing a series of plan &amp; forward phases through which devices self-organize into forwarding groups that propagate data over discovered paths. FPSP performs a limited number of long range, high power data transmissions to collect information regarding the neighboring devices. The acquired information, allows to plan a (parameterizable long by λ) sequence of short range, low power transmissions between nearby particles, based on certain optimization criteria. All particles that decide to respond (based on local criteria) to these long range transmissions enter the forwarding phase during which information is propagated via the acquired plan. Clearly, the duration of the forwarding phases is characterized by the parameter λ, the transmission medium and the processing speed of the devices. In fact the parameter λ provides a mechanism to adjust the protocol performance in terms of the latency-energy trade-off. By reducing λ the latency is reduced at the cost of spending extra energy, while by increasing λ, the energy dissipation is reduced but the latency is increased. To control the success rate-energy trade-off, particles react locally on environment and context changes by using a set of rules that are based on response thresholds that relate individual-level plasticity with network-level resiliency, motivated by the nature-inspired method for dividing labor, a metaphor of social insect behavior for solving problems [1], Each particle has an individual response threshold θ that is related to the "local" density (as observed by the particle, [2]); particles engage in propagation of events when the level of the task-associated stimuli exceeds their thresholds. Let s be the intensity of a stimulus associated with a particular sensing task, set by the human authorities. We adopt the response function Tθ(s) = sn/s n+θn, the probability of performing the task as a function of s, where n &gt; 1 determines the steepness of the threshold. Thus, when θ is small (i.e. the network is sparse) then the response probability increases; when s increases (i.e. for critical sensing tasks) the response probability increases as well. This role-based approach where a selective number of devices do the high cost planning and the rest of the network operates in a low cost state leads to systems that have increased energy efficiency and high fault-tolerance since these long range planning phases allow to bypass obstacles (where no sensors are available) or faulty sensors (that have been disabled due to power failure or other natural events).</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: Seventeenth Annual ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures; Conference date: 18 July 2005 through 20 July 2005; Conference code: 66541</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-32144460315&amp;doi=10.1145%2f1073970.1074003&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f7e86dd52f6e9b54f4080e1afd651eed</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Annu.

Schools of naval mammals provide the proof that also individual members of the group can achieve higher leveled intelligence independent of the simplicity of their collective behavior. Due to their structurally and functionally modularized brain organization, dolphins are capable of language based communication and learning complex motions by human training. Inspired by dolphins, 3 modules for the behavior controller can be conceptualized. The swarming module optimized by evolutionary methods represents the basic behavior given in the natural environment. The mission module includes extendable sets of behavior primitives that can be structured by reinforcement learning. A knowledge based sensing module can be implemented separately to increase the information reliability. With this approach, subaqueous robot schools can be expected to perform more advanced tasks than just moving as a swarm. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.-U.

Once removed from the energy management loop, the human operator is free to concentrate on higher level task management and data analysis. This paper firstly describes the design, test and construction of an autonomous Ground Recharge Stations (GRS) for battery-powered quadrotor helicopter. In order to incorporate the charging of the quadrotors in the overall swarm behaviour, the focus of the research presented here has been to reduce the charging phase of a single vehicle by developing safer electrical contacts and using a balancer in the charging process. The amount of extra current available from the new design easily pushed the flying-time/charging- time ratio of the quadrotors over 1. The paper then describes a novel approach for the integration of this technology into an energy efficient multi-agent system. The development of a prioritisation function and queuing protocols between the UAVs and GRSs demonstrate an optimised solution to the assignment problem dependent on the mission profile. Numerical experiments show that the system's energy management remains efficient regardless of number and position of the platforms, or nature of the environment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: J.

The FANET task allocation problem is one-to-one assignment of agents to tasks so that the overall benefit of all the agents is maximized by taking delays and costs into account, given a set of agents and a set of tasks. A coordination based task allocation system ensuring spatial and temporal coordination between UAVs is essential for FANETs. In this paper, a new multi UAV task planning heuristic is proposed for FANETs to visit all target points in a minimum time, while preserving all time network connectivity. Effectiveness in the mission execution and cost efficiency in the task allocation have been presented by conducting a bunch of experiments performed on 2D terrains.

At the heart of this vision, cascading unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) into a "SWARM" of connectivity nodes offers great flexibility and modularity. The USVs must be able to provide a network of communication data relays, a common tactical picture and mapping for situational awareness. The vehicles must also possess robust communications resistant to jamming, fading and interference while acquiring a high speed data exchange for processing and fusion of information. Reliable wireless network with high data throughput is essential in various military wireless communication systems. While the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication schemes have the potential to exceed the single-input single-output (SISO) Shannon capacity bound, equipping a large number of antennas in a USV is practically impossible. To increase the diversity gain beyond the number of physical antennas, cooperative wireless networks that exploit cooperation among multiple terminals become essential. This paper proposes novel cooperative wireless networking schemes and practical coding designs that provide the USV Swarm reliable wireless links with the overall data throughput and the communication quality significantly exceeding those of the existing non-cooperative systems.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

In particular, the payload is distributed over multiple satellites belonging to the same mission. Swarms of separated elements cooperating coherently can be used to perform simultaneous scientific measurements of the space environment or implemented as large virtual, sparse apertures in space for high-resolution radar imagery of Earth, interferometry and high gain communications. Advantages of distributed constellations of micro-satellites over traditional single-satellite deployments include increased performance, redundancy and the possibility of reducing the overall cost, in term of launch cost and mission recovery by the substitution of a failed component. These improvements make the implementation of these swarm systems attractive as the functionality is spread over a number of cooperating satellites, thus enabling new missions which would not be possible with a single satellite. The challenges in controlling singularly a large number of elements are, though, enormous: the autonomy of the whole swarm is thus necessary. Swarm- intelligence is the scientific discipline that is expected to give an answer to this technological challenge. Multi-robot autonomous planetary exploration, on-orbit self-assembly, multiple coordinated observations (sensor-webs), are just examples of what could be achieved by the development of a flexible, robust, decentralised, and self-organized system exploiting collective emerging behaviours. The use of swarm robotics is also relevant for advanced mission architectures such as those recently studied by ESA (APIES mission) and NASA (ANTS mission) making use of satellite swarms to explore the asteroid belt or planetary surfaces. In the present paper we present the system design of a single collaborative -satellite swarm component and we analyse the various subsystems including power, propulsion, communication and the relative/absolute position sensors. We give a number of design options for the swarm element, associated to different performance levels, weights and dimensions. Possible in-orbit operations of the pico-satellite swarm architecture are then evaluated based on the Delta-V and the communications/sensing capabilities obtained as a result of the spacecraft system design. In particular, the operational phase is studied relying upon novel techniques based on swarm intelligence and behavioural robotics. These help to cope with the limited capabilities of a swarm element and thus to reach the required global swarm behaviour. Starting from the results achieved during the swarm element design and the in-orbit dynamical simulations, we critically argue on the feasibility of a number of applications recently proposed for in-orbit swarms.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.

As one possible scenario, swarms of collaborating UAVs can be envisioned and allow for more complex missions and scenarios. One essential building block in simultaneously operating several UAVs is the UAS internal and external communication. Ground control station operators need to communicate guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) data, external beneficiaries of the UAS operation need to be provided with obtained sensor data and intelligence. All this requires sophisticated wireless communication networks and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) step into the picture. However, evaluating the performance of different MANETs in a UAS environment is non-trivial: relevant metrics and evaluation procedures have to be established for a simulation based performance prediction during the design phase of a MANET. Unfortunately, published results on MANET performance are not necessarily comparable across different papers, due to differences in the underlying assumptions. Some findings might not even be applicable to a UAS environment. This paper proposes a set of reference scenarios in order to allow for comparable and applicable results in MANET simulations. The presented scenarios mimic realistic UAS missions, both, on the operational side of the participating network nodes, as well as on the network traffic side. The reference scenarios capture the essence of current UAVs and UAS missions in a civil, research, or military context, hence providing the means to simulate different MANET protocols in a UAS setting. © 2008 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78651109241&amp;doi=10.2514%2f6.2008-7042&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9e32eecd4012968937e0c0ab20a80722</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>AIAA Model.

The Membership Functions (MFs) of the FLCD algorithm are designed using a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, in order to achieve optimal performance on all the major performance metrics of IP congestion control. The FLCD algorithm achieves better performance when compared to the basic Fuzzy Logic AQM and Random Explicit Marking (REM) algorithms. Since the optimization process is undertaken offline and is based on a single optimization script, the performance of the FLCD algorithm may not be optimal under different network conditions, due to the fact that the IP environment is characterized by dynamic traffic patterns. This paper proposes two online self-learning and organization structures that enable the FLCD algorithm to learn the system conditions and adjust the fuzzy rule base in accordance with prevailing conditions. The self-organized FLCD algorithm is compared with the unorganized FLCD, the basic Fuzzy Logic AQM and the Adaptive Random Early Detection (RED) algorithms using simulations with dynamic traffic patterns. Performance results show that the self-organized FLCD algorithm is more robust than the other algorithms. Compared to the unorganized FLCD, the new scheme improves the UDP traffic delay for short round trip times and also reduces packet loss rates. In terms of jitter, fairness and link utilization, it exhibits a similar performance to the unorganized FLCD algorithm. © Sharif University of Technology.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: D.S.

Once removed from the energy management loop, the human operator is free to concentrate on higher level task management and data analysis. This paper firstly describes the design, test and construction of an autonomous Ground Recharge Stations (GRS) for battery-powered quadrotor helicopter. In order to incorporate the charging of the quadrotors in the overall swarm behaviour, the focus of the research presented here has been to reduce the charging phase of a single vehicle by developing safer electrical contacts and using a balancer in the charging process. The amount of extra current available from the new design easily pushed the flying-time/charging- time ratio of the quadrotors over 1. Then the paper describes a novel approach for the integration of this technology into an energy efficient multi-agent system. The development of a prioritisation function and queuing protocols between the UAVs and GRSs guarantee an optimised solution to the assignment problem dependent on the mission profile. Results show that the system's energy management remains efficient regardless of number and position of the platforms, or nature of the environment. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 14; Conference name: 2013 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2013; Conference date: 28 May 2013 through 28 May 2013; Conference code: 98737</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883110733&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICUAS.2013.6564681&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2ff63f6908d163d662c3bffeabb63143</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Int.

When there is no effective protocol to save power, then the routing among the nodes is difficult. Underwater Acoustic Sensor networks are mainly used for monitoring instruments, controlling of pollution, recording of changes in climate, natural disaster prediction, search missions and marine life study. The underwater network data transmission among the nodes or in a rout, needs a continuous communication. Else it makes data loss and it cannot be recoverable by any other node or by the base station. In such a situation it is necessary to ensure that the energy efficient network is adopted. In order to provide energy efficiency in routing with successful data transmission, this paper introduces an optimized energy efficient routing protocol [OEERP] via nodes having highest energy in a shortest path where the node highest energy and path least distance is optimized using AFISHS optimization algorithm. FISH is a Bio-inspired optimization algorithm, where it is too dynamic, repetitive and reliable. It provides the optimized highest energy nodes sited in a least distance based shortest path in the network. The simulation result shows the performance evaluation of the proposed AFISHS optimization algorithm than the existing ACO algorithm in various factors like Energy, PDR, and throughput and data loss. In terms of energy, throughput, PDR are increased as 5.5% Joules, 12% kb/sec and 0.6% of packets respectively than the Existing approaches. © 2014 Research India Publications.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931275611&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8fd1b349d5cf5914b3bdd89e32909219</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernardino, A.M.</author><author>Bernardino, E.M.</author><author>Sánchez-Pérez, J.M.</author><author>Gómez-Pulido, J.A.</author><author>Vega-Rodríguez, M.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Solving the non-split weighted ring arc-loading problem in a resilient packet ring using particle swarm optimization</title><secondary-title>IJCCI 2009 - International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IJCCI - Int.

Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), also known as IEEE 802.17, is a standard designed for the optimized transport of data traffic over optical fiber ring networks. Its design is to provide the resilience found in SONET/SDH networks but instead of setting up circuit oriented connections, providing a packet based transmission. This is to increase the efficiency of Ethernet and IP services. In this paper, a weighted ring arc-loading problem (WRALP) is considered which arises in engineering and planning of the RPR systems (combinatorial optimization NP- complete problem). Specifically, for a given set of non-split and uni-directional point-to-point demands (weights), the objective is to find the routing for each demand (i.e., assignment of the demand to either clockwise or counter-clockwise ring) so that the maximum arc load is minimized. This paper suggests four variants of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), combined with a Local Search (LS) method to efficient non-split traffic loading on the RPR. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: A. M.

These impediments motivate centralized architectures for multi-UAV planning and coordination. The key problem stems from the need for a human to continuously monitor the UAVs' data streams. We discuss a hierarchical distributed task assignment algorithm, called the team consensus based bundle algorithm, that keeps these four impediments in check. Furthermore, a multi-socket manager (MSM) is presented, which was designed with these four impediments in mind.

The search protocol, the UAV Search Mission Protocol (USMP), combines inter-UAV communication with geographic routing to improve search efficiency in terms of total searches, distance traveled by UAVs, and the minimization of UAV direction changes. By determining where search state updates impact search decisions, messages are geographically routed to improve search efficiency. USMP and the geographic greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) protocol are studied via simulation using OPNET Modeler 12.0. Geographic routing degrades performance by at least 20% in total searches and distance traveled, but improves direction changes by 6.7%. Overall, USMP improves performance by as much as 188% compared to scenarios without inter-UAV communication. © 2009 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 30; Conference name: 7th Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, PerCom 2009; Conference date: 9 March 2009 through 13 March 2009; Conference code: 77122</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70349329598&amp;doi=10.1109%2fPERCOM.2009.4912764&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=76a7960a059d0099463852c51cee7ee3</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Annu.

Their vision is of a self- synchronizing, horizontally integrated 'swarm' of sensors, processing elements and communication assets that autonomously organize to meet the dynamically evolving ISR needs of future missions/campaigns. This paper describes an analysis workstation that is being constructed to support the evaluation of alternative designs for such a system. Within the workstation a complex adaptive system models the dynamic formation of collection teams while evolutionary algorithms, operating at the agent level, attempt to optimize the global performance of the ISR family of systems by modifying the various agent's responsiveness to attributes of the 'support requests'. Joint MEASURE, a DEVS based Monte Carlo mission effectiveness simulator developed by Lockheed Martin, provides the infrastructure for this workstation enabling the unpredictability of scenario evolution to be an integral element of the optimized solution.

These next generation multi-vehicle UAV systems work as a collaborative autonomous unit, receiving only high-level mission commands, and require little human intervention for control. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) is involved in a multi-year R&amp;D program to develop "strong autonomy" based on innovative scalable architectures for high-level autonomy and emergent group behavior in distributed vehicle systems that include both UAVs and small robots. JHU/APL has developed a reliable, robust communications architecture to manage the input and output of "belief" messages. This architecture comprises the content, structure, prioritization, broadcast scheduling, and reception of these messages. The architecture also includes the physical wireless link between vehicles, which for these proof-of-concept demonstrations is an ad hoc IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network (WLAN). The communications architecture supports three primary services: Periodic Packet Multicast service, On-Demand Packet Broadcast service, and Operation, Administration, and Management (OAM) service. The former two services are for transport of beliefs. The OAM service allows configuration of internal default parameters and allows access to its internal status and statistical counters. The architecture provides these services by supporting three interfaces: the Belief Transmit Service Interface (BTSI), Belief Receive Service Interlace (BRSI), and OAM Interface (OAMI). Along with the architecture description, this paper presents actual field demonstration results of multiple ground and aerial vehicle systems.

To mitigate the effect of these failures, fault tolerance becomes imperative. Nonetheless, it remains to be a second tier activity-it should not undermine the execution of the mission oriented tasks of WSNs through overly taxing their resources. We define architecture for fault tolerance in WSNs that is based on a federation of mobile agents that is used both for diagnostic intelligence and repair regimen, focusing on being lightweight in energy, communication and resources. Mobile agents are classified here as local, metropolitan, and global, providing fault tolerance at node, network and functional levels. Interactions between mobile agents are inspired by honey bee dance language that builds on semantics of errors classification and their demographic distribution. Our quantitative modeling substantiates that the proposed fault tolerance framework mandates minimalist communication through contextualized bee-inspired interactions, achieving adaptive sensitivity, and hysteresis-based stability. © 2010 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: S.

As objectives of these missions become more ambitious, there are still problems in increasing the number of communication windows, supporting multiple signals, and increasing data rates over reliable intersatellite and ground links to Earth. Also, there is a shortage of available frequencies in the 2 m and 70 cm bands due to rapid increase in the number of CubeSats orbiting the Earth - leading to further regulatory issues. Existing communication systems and radio signal processing Intellectual Property (IP) cores cannot fully address these challenges. One of the possible strategies to solve these issues is by equipping satellites with a Software Defined Radio (SDR). SDR is a key area to realise various software implementations which enable an adaptive and reconfigurable communication system without changing any hardware device or feature. This paper proposes a new SDR architecture which utilises a combination of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and field programmable Radio Frequency (RF) transceiver to solve back-end and front- end challenges and thereby enabling reception of multiple signals or satellites using single user equipment. © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 41; Conference name: 2014 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems, AHS 2014; Conference date: 14 July 2014 through 18 July 2014; Conference code: 107216</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906653723&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAHS.2014.6880174&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=04562ab38f85e22af6cc4e9dbd0fe1e9</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc.

In many situations, stand-off remote-sensing and hazard-interdiction techniques over realistic operational areas are often impractical and difficult to characterize. An alternative approach is to implement adaptive remote-sensing techniques with swarms of mobile agents employing collective behavior for optimization of mapping signatures and positional orientation (registration). We have expanded intelligent control theory using physics-based collective behavior models and genetic algorithms to produce a uniquely powerful implementation of distributed ground-based measurement incorporating both local collective behavior, and inter-operative global optimization for sensor fusion and mission oversight. By using a layered hierarchical control architecture to orchestrate adaptive reconfiguration of semi-autonomous robotic agents, we can improve overall robustness and functionality in dynamic tactical environments without information bottlenecking. In our concept, each sensor is equipped with a miniaturized optical reflectance modulator which is interactively monitored as a remote transponder using a laser communication protocol from a remote mothership or operative. Robot data-sharing at the ground level can be leveraged with global evaluation criteria, including terrain overlays and remote imaging data. Information sharing and distributed intelligence opens up a new class of remote sensing applications in which small single-function autonomous observers at the local level can collectively optimize and measure large scale ground-level signatures. As the need for coverage and the number of agents grows to improve spatial resolution, cooperative behavior orchestrated by a global situational awareness umbrella will be an essential ingredient to offset increasing bandwidth requirements within the net. A system of this type is being developed which will be capable of sensitively detecting, tracking, and mapping spatial distributions of measurement signatures, which are nonstationary or obscured by clutter or interfering obstacles by virtue of adaptive reconfiguration. This methodology is being used to field an adaptive ground-penetrating impulse radar from a superposition of small radiating dipoles for detection of underground structures and to detect/remediate hazardous biological or chemical species in migrating plumes.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: Proceedings of the 1999 Unattended Ground Sensor Technologies and Applications; Conference date: 8 April 1999 through 9 April 1999; Conference code: 55685; CODEN: PSISD</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032684825&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.357131&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=79d64375236a6f406a992589a01f6e06</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sonnenberg, J.</author><author>Chester, D.B.</author><author>Schroeder, J.</author><author>Olds, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the relative merits of genetic and swarm algorithms for network optimization in cognitive radio networks</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Parameter estimation</keyword><keyword>Engines</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Military communications</keyword><keyword>Cognitive radio</keyword><keyword>Cognitive engines</keyword><keyword>Cognitive network</keyword><keyword>Cognitive radio network</keyword><keyword>Network optimization</keyword><keyword>Radio systems</keyword><keyword>Significant differences</keyword><keyword>Swarm algorithms</keyword><keyword>Tiered architecture</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>978-146731729-0 (ISBN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415590</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cognitive engines have been under study and development for a number of years as a technique for addressing the needs of cognitive radios [1,2,3]. More recently there has been effort to expand the role of the cognitive engine to address the needs of a network of cognitive radios [4,5]. Haykin [6] has demonstrated that there is a significant difference between a network of cognitive radios and a cognitive radio network. This paper addresses three questions: 1. What are the significant functional and parametric differences between cognitive algorithms that deal with optimizing the operations of a cognitive radio and cognitive algorithms that optimize the operations of a cognitive radio network? 2. What are the trade-offs in applying the various algorithms to each task? 3. Which algorithms are optimal for the networking tasks? This paper identifies a set of parameters that characterize candidate algorithms and explores the benefits and drawbacks of each for cognitive network tasks. We propose a tiered architecture of cognitive engine algorithms that work in tandem to optimize the use of cognitive networked radios for the optimal success of the networked mission. © 2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: J.

In this paper, we give some novel adaptation to the recent bio-inspired optimization approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to form a suitable algorithm for the base station placement problem. Considering the two most important factors simultaneously, coverage and economy efficiency, we can get a Pareto optimal set by using the Divided Range Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (DRMPSO) which is performed in distributed computing. The Pareto optimal set is a set of solutions which are optimal with respect to constrained conditions and non-inferior to each other.

This article looks at the emergent properties of the system as a whole based on local spacecraft behaviors, and how these behaviors can be adjusted to achieve mission goals. The significance of this approach is that it frees the ground station from the micromanagement of individual spacecraft (despite the lack of intersatellite links) which is a crucial requirement for the feasibility of future cluster/swarm missions. To understand the system fully, an analysis is presented for simple systems that have different characteristics. Performance is evaluated in terms of intuitive behaviors (greedy, considerate, proactive, and obstinate) that are mathematically defined. This reveals that performance can be steadily improved by making the behaviors more "self-aware." Simulations are then extended to swarms involving larger numbers of spacecraft to demonstrate scalability and more realistic scenarios for practicality.The final contribution of thiswork is to introduce various mechanisms for supervisors, and/or the ground station, to dynamically adjust behavior to achieve load balancing across the cluster.

As unmanned vehicles, communications and sensors have matured sufficiently to enable large field deployments, multiple unmanned vehicles (UxVs) performing a single unified mission becomes achievable. This new paradigm requires reliable information sharing and coordination in ad-hoc, unreliable and/or low-bandwidth environments, the ability to collaboratively achieve coordinated goals, and autonomous adaptation to uncertain, dynamic environments. Our approach implements a distributed agent architecture, wherein mission CONOPS and rules of engagement are represented by agent roles, behaviors and actions. System performance is scalable to hundreds of nodes by progressively limiting the scope of distributed information according to collaborative need or relevance. Autonomous field management provides for long-term persistence and performance via adaptation, replenishment, and in-situ recharging. This paper will present our collaborative autonomy software architecture, including mechanisms for abstracting field behaviors from platform capabilities, and maintaining field performance under possible field attrition. Implementation of our approach for collaborative, heterogeneous UAV air mission is presented as a concept illustration. An application of CoMPACT to swarms of UAVs performing a complex ISR and SEAD mission is presented in a companion AUVSI paper [1].</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: R.

Instead of sending specially equipped forces with expensive transport and measurement devices into the contaminated area, our proposed system makes use of an autonomous, wireless connected swarm of Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAV), often simply known as drones, that are featured with lightweight mobile sensor systems. In this paper we will be particularly focusing on the complex communication system, which on the one hand has to organize the on-board-communication between the control systems of the MUAV and the sensors and on the other hand has to establish wireless connections to the mission control center on the ground as well as to neighboring MUAVs in the air via a mesh network. © 2009 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 107; Correspondence Address: K.

At the first level of hierarchy, we aggregate the high-dimensional control system of the swarm into a small-dimensional control system capturing its essential features. These features describe the position of the swarm in the world and its size. At the second level, we reduce the problem of controlling the essential features of the swarm to a model-checking problem. In the obtained hierarchical framework, high-level specifications given in natural language, such as linear temporal logic formulas over linear predicates in the essential features, are automatically mapped to provably correct robot control laws. For the particular case of an abstraction based on centroid and variance, we show that swarm cohesion, interrobot collision avoidance, and environment containment can also be specified and automatically guaranteed in our framework.

There is no infrastructure support and sensor nodes communicate with each other only when they are in transmission range. To a greater degree than the terminals found in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) for communications, sensor nodes are resource-constrained, with limited computational processing, bandwidth, memory, and power, and are typically unattended once in operation. Consequently, the level of information exchange among nodes, to support any complex adaptive algorithms to establish network connectivity and optimize throughput, not only deplete those limited resources and creates high overhead in narrowband communications, but also increase network vulnerability to eavesdropping by malicious nodes. Cooperation among nodes, critical to the mission of sensor networks, can thus be disrupted by the inappropriate choice of the method for self-organization. Recent published contributions to the self-configuration of ad hoc sensor networks, e.g., self-organizing mapping and swarm intelligence techniques, have been based on the adaptive control of the cross-layer interactions found in MANET protocols to achieve one or more performance objectives: connectivity, intrusion resistance, power control, throughput, and delay. However, few studies have examined the performance of these algorithms when implemented with the limited resources of WSNs. In this paper, self-organization algorithms for the initiation, operation and maintenance of a network topology from a collection of wireless sensor nodes are proposed that improve the performance metrics significant to WSNs. The intelligent algorithm approach emphasizes low computational complexity, energy efficiency and robust adaptation to change, allowing distributed implementation with the actual limited resources of the cooperative nodes of the network. Extensions of the algorithms from flat topologies to two-tier hierarchies of sensor nodes are presented. Results from a few simulations of the proposed algorithms are compared to the published results of other approaches to sensor network self-organization in common scenarios.

However satellite's lifetime decreases very quickly when the mission requires to orbit into the dense layers of the atmosphere. The mission performance could be enhanced using innovative propulsion techniques, counteracting the effect of atmospheric drag. Among these, laser propulsion potentially offers great weight and power savings, obtained by separating the propulsion system energy source from the propelled satellite. The energy source for the propulsion system is a pulsed laser beam generated remotely, while only collecting mirrors and ablative material are necessary on the target spacecraft. A mission architecture for very low altitude nanosatellite swarms using a space-based pulsed laser propulsion is described. A simplified laser-sustained re-orbiting maneuver sequence is proposed, leading to a straightforward evaluation of the maneuver times, showing that the laser propulsion system is suitable for low altitude nanosatellite missions.

Swarm technologies [11] use context-awareness in short-haul networks between components, and long-distance networks allow communication with Earth. However, the propagation delays limit real-time communications, deep space being an environment in which the speed of light becomes a restriction. Therefore, the development of a protocol stack which is adaptive to application requirements and external influences will help to maximise communication synchronicity. As part of a first year doctorate research programme, this paper correlates current stack functionalities with interplanetary application requirements. A redesigned stack proposes to resolve this misalignment Context-awareness is incorporated, enabling intelligent protocol selection using application layer knowledge and environmental information, with particular attention given to transport protocols. The paper concludes by considering transport protocol characteristics when deployed beside a context-aware layer, with the longterm aim being the development of a transport protocol suitable for deployment in the state-of-the-art context-aware stack. © 2006 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: C.

Typical applications for microsatellite swarms are phased array telescopes, interferometric missions, and space-based radar. Key drivers for an optical terminal are well-developed technology and ruggedness. The terminal should do without automatic tracking or fine pointing, coarse pointing should be simple. As an example we cover a scenario where four microsatellites form a planar, square formation of 1 km side length, where the data rate is 100 kbit/s, and where an active double-pass lidar between each of the satellites provides a ranging accuracy of better than 10 m.

They navigate by overhead satellites, synchronize their flight paths with other vehicles, swarm over hostile territory and attack multiple targets. Studying these engagements with high-fidelity constructive simulations has become an important task of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). The simulation framework Computer Aided Design of Aerospace Concepts (CADAC) has its roots in FORTRAN code that dates back to the 1960s and was used by industry and the U.S. Air Force to simulate aerospace vehicles in all flight environments. To adapt CADAC to the new environment, a complete rewrite was carried out in C++, taking advantage of object-oriented programming techniques. The architecture of CADAC++ is based on the hierarchical structure of inherited classes. The vehicles (aircraft, missiles, satellites or ground targets), inherit the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) equations of motion from the classes 'Flat6' or 'Round6', conveying either the flat or elliptical Earth model. In turn, these classes inherit the communication structure from the base class 'Cadac'. The components of the vehicle, e.g., aerodynamics, propulsion and autopilot, are represented by modules, which are member functions of the vehicle class. Communication among the modules occurs by protected module-variable arrays. Every instantiated vehicle object is encapsulated with its methods and data. To communicate between vehicles, data packets are loaded onto a global data bus for recall by other vehicles. Input occurs by ASCII file and output is compatible with CADAC Studio, a plotting and data processing package. CADAC++ is chiefly an engineering tool for refining the components of the primary vehicle and exploring its performance as it interacts (possibly repeatedly instantiated) with the multi-object environment. Its modular structure enables reuse of component models across simulations. In the 10 years of development, CADAC++ based constructive simulations have been built for many types of aerospace vehicles and integrated with mission-level simulations. © 2012 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: P.

Each UAV in the team uses inertial sensor and terrain sensor information to simultaneously localise the UAV while building a point feature map of the surrounding terrain, where map information is shared between vehicles over a data fusion network. Multi-vehicle active SLAM control architectures are proposed that actively plan the trajectories and motions of each of the vehicles in the team based on maximising information in the localisation and mapping estimates. We demonstrate and compare an ideal, centralised architecture, where a central planning node chooses optimal actions for each UAV, and a coordinated, decentralised architecture, where UAVs make their own control decisions based on common shared map information. The different architectures involve varying degrees of complexity and optimality through differing communications and computational requirements.

The main goal is to explore the use of MAS to simulate spatial scenarios based on modelling multi-actor decision-making within a spatial planning process. We demonstrate MAS that consists of agents representing organizations and interest groups involved in an urban allocation problem during a land use planning process. The multi-actor based decision-making is modelled by generating beliefs and preferences of actors about the location of and relation between spatial objects. This allows each agent to confront these beliefs and preferences with it's own desires and with that of other agents. The MAS loosely resembles belief, desire and intentions architecture. Based on a case study for a hypothetical land use planning situation in a study area in the Netherlands we discuss the potential and limitations of the MAS to build models that enable spatial planners to include the 'actor factor' in their analysis and design of spatial scenarios. In addition, our experiments revealed the need for further research on the representation of spatial objects and reasoning, learning and communication about allocation problems using MAS. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the planning horizon spans tens of years, a certain amount of uncertainty is inherent in forecasting the deteriorating process and the costs and effects of maintenance actions. This paper proposes a multiobjective simulation optimization framework to establish the trade-off among the expected values of life-cycle maintenance cost and of the performance measures. The trade-off information, represented as the Pareto front, gives planners sufficient flexibility to respond to various needs. The optimization is performed by a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, while MonteCarlo simulation is used to model the uncertainties. To alleviate the computational burden, the proposed framework is implemented in a parallel computing platform, where three programming paradigms (master-slave, island, and diffusion) are developed to distribute computation across processors and to control interprocessor communication. The validity of the proposed framework, along with the parallel paradigms, is investigated through a practical case. It is shown statistically that the proposed MOPSO algorithm is superior to the well-known nondominating sorting genetic algorithm II as the former can obtain a better Pareto front, whose convergence and diversity are measured together by the hypervolume indicator. Both the island and diffusion paradigms, being loosely synchronous, exhibit high efficiency and good scalability as they achieve superlinear speedups.

Briefly, the greater the number of processors, the less the chance of error and the better the analogical match that can be found in the processing time allowed. Clearly, any practical science of design should allow the human in the loop to do what he/she does best while at the same time utilize the robot to do what it does best. Such an eminently practical symbiosis is based on the science of randomization as defined by Chaitin, Kolmogorov, Rubin, Solomonoff, and Uspenskii [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Here, repetitive or symmetric actions such as testing evolutionary alternatives are carried out by a fast computer, while novel or -random actions such as that of providing a model definition are realized by the human. Autonomous behavior may be determined by the interaction of simple heuristics, rather than through the design of complex software that is difficult to maintain. The emergent behavior of simple heuristics is not only universal, but potentially at least as complex as that of any other design for the realization of software control systems. While any autonomous vehicle equipped with suitable sensors can be autonomously guided by an appropriate set of heuristics, the acquisition of such a base has proven to be elusive to date. This document provides a forum for some preliminary results in the area of knowledge amplification as well as a setting for projected future research in the area of intelligence. The problems encountered in developing a set of heuristics to guide an autonomous vehicle include: Rules are too crisp and not sufficiently flexible to cover real-world situations. No one knows all of the rules needed in advance. Fuzzy logic only addresses quantitative aspects of the rules; whereas, the qualitative aspects are at least as important. Conventional rule acquisition is slow and otherwise impractical. Neural networks cannot plan effectively. Neural networks cannot learn nearly fast enough to be used in conjunction with a human trainer. Cases cannot be autonomously adapted, which limits the applicability of CBR here. Systems do not grow their knowledge bases by sharing, which limits the acquisition of knowledge by swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Algorithmic control aspects need to be processed separately and locally. No one would be a pilot if they lacked common sense. They can learn how to fly, but without common sense, they are preordained to fail. Yet, our predecessors have sought to build UAVs that are lacking in this most critical capability - presumably because they are of the mistaken belief that computers can never exhibit commonsense reasoning beyond that for which they are explicitly programmed. However, knowledge amplifiers, known as KASERs, have been designed and patented by one of the authors [6] and elsewhere, which allow for the symmetric expansion of a knowledge base - enabling heuristic programs to reason by analogy - just like human pilots. Applications for autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles such as the UAVs that support the US military in reconnaissance missions (Predator and the GlobalHawk, for example) or could support our civilian forces using autonomous robot colonies (in rescue missions such as the events surrounding the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City bombing, or in homeland security, for example) continue to spurn new research and development efforts in intelligent agents, light-weight material, fuel-cell based propulsion, hybrid engine designs, smart sensor networks, secure wireless communication networks, and energy-efficient computing architectures. Further, with the advent of advances in nanotechnology and microsystems, several research teams continue to investigate the integration of such technologies for small swarms of AVs or SAVs for military, commercial, and civilian applications. SSC-PAC has designed, developed, patented, and in some cases transitioned intelligent systems, which serve to automate the creation, testing, and maintenance of complex software systems. Subsequently, the co-authors have collaborated on the construction of a Cognitive KASER for learning and have investigated its application to such areas as web searching and decision support architectures. A brief summary of the work in knowledge amplification is provided in Section III. In summary, in order to test a new learning approach that can bestow intelligence on a system, based upon human (tutor) - robot (student) interaction, we are working jointly to design an intelligent system architecture, based on the KASER, and plan to implement the methodology on an aerial vehicle (a helicopter), which will execute several maneuvers such as basic hovering, steep approach, confined area approach, and basic altitude flying. The software to perform these maneuvers will be developed using two methods (teach mode with a human-in-the-loop) and classical control. Then, the knowledge amplification system will autonomously generate another set of software, which will then be tested and compared to the execution of the baseline two software codes using the same helicopter flight scenarios. We anticipate that such complex functional real-time software can be most cost-effectively written through the use of a software-writing system embodying knowledge amplification. © 2011 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings.

UAVs should collect data for a defined area with a variety of sensors. When these UAVs are operating in swarm formation, the observation area could be increased and it would also be possible to deal with a loss of a UAV. The big amount of data produced by the UAVs requires high date rate connectivity, therefore the free space optical (FSO) communication is suitable. When using FSO links some important issues need be considered, the beam attenuation due the atmosphere on one side and the alignment of the FSO units on the other side. The alignment raises technical challenges in tracking and acquisition. The combination of UAVs with the FSO communication is an interesting investigative scenario and some of the important aspects of this ambitious design are the main focus of this paper. ©2007 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 27; Conference name: 2007 9th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks, ICTON 2007; Conference date: 1 July 2007 through 5 July 2007; Conference code: 72874</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48349143182&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICTON.2007.4296268&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=dd7fc46e03b817623e49e36e25efb4f9</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc.

Generating architectures for a SoS is a multi-objective optimization problem with large number of variables and constraints. The paper presents several of computational intelligence techniques that can generate SoS architectures, such as genetic algorithms (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with Type 2 Fuzzy logic nets. The Maritime search and rescue (SAR) was used as a SoS domain scenario to both implement and demonstrate the architecting methodology. SAR utilizes a variety of systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), coordination command control, communication systems and other larger manned vessels. The proposed methodology delivers SoS architects of SAR missions the ability to exploit the interdependence among all systems as well as individual system's inherent characteristics to satisfy stakeholders' desired attributes. The architect is thus able to design architectures that are robust, efficient, net-centric, and affordable. © 2014 The Authors.

Therefore, this paper proposes a modularized control architecture that represents the imitation of dolphin's phylogenetic species intelligence such as sensing and interpreting abilities and swarming habits of dolphins, but also additional skills from the learned intelligence. The swarming represents the basic behavior given in the natural environment. The mission consisting of behavior primitives can be structured by reinforcement learning to perform advanced missions.

However, most studies have mainly focused on protocols for applications in which network performance assurances are not considered essential. With the emergence of mission-critical applications, performance control mechanisms are considered of prime importance. Performance control can be carried out by robust congestion control approaches that aim to keep the network operational under varying network conditions. Swarm intelligence is successfully employed to combat congestion by mimicking the collective behavior of bird flocks. In this way, the emerging global behavior of minimum congestion is achieved collectively. A flock-based congestion control (Flock-CC) approach was proposed in the past. This paper presents a new, simpler Flock-CC approach. Performance evaluations focus on parameter setting and on comparative studies between the new and the earlier version of Flock-CC. © 2011 ACM.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: P.

In this paper we identify scaling issues and present some simple results in the domain of individual mobile robots, as well as teams, swarms, etc., deployed on sensing missions. Since most robot-based sensing missions anticipate mini-, micro-, and nano-scale robots, our explicit examples focus on scaling-down of existing humanscale robot designs and concepts. However the principles articulated apply equally to scaling-up situations. The topic is introduced via a simple example that shows why scaling-down of mobile robots that carry their own energy source will generally prove impractical: to obtain reasonable operating times it will rather be necessary to develop small robots into which energy can be beamed, or which can forage for energy sources in the environment. From this concrete illustrative example, the paper moves on to a higher level discussion of robot architecture and the applicability of scaling principles, to varying degrees, to all the modules, i.e., it is not exclusively a mobility issue. There follows a short discussion of how changes of scale are not inherently problematic, but to the contrary, in many cases suitable scale change provides the key to solving a difficult engineering problem. The final section is a quantitative example in which design and operating parameters of the robotic nodes of a sensor network are considered from the perspective of operating time limited by the energy cost of node-to-node communication. This example powerfully illustrates a system in which fairly modest changes contemplated range of engineering parameters result in enormous changes in the anticipated operating time of the system.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: M.

Future missions involve sending spacecraft and robots to harsh environments, where resilience is necessary for the survival of the mission. In addition, distances and communication lead times between the spacecraft and Earth necessitate much of the mission operation being autonomous. We have been conducting research on the development of autonomous space exploration missions based on principles from Autonomic Computing (AC), whereby the mission is imbued with self-management capabilities. Such missions will involve several, rather than single, spacecraft, robots or other devices, operating in collaboration. We describe one such concept mission, ANTS (Autonomous Nano-Technology Swarm), which involves a number of sub-missions that are self-similar. Our work in this, and other future missions, has involved the use of techniques from AC for building in self-management, and ultimately self-governance. We have also explored the use of formal methods to gain confidence in the correct behavior of the mission. Since both the physical devices which will be used for exploration, and the software that is essential for their successful deployment, lend themselves to a product-line approach, we have been exploiting techniques from software product-line engineering, in particular Multi-Agent System Product Lines (MAS-PL) and Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL). © 2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

For instance, it could be possible to have a team of UAV acting as weather sensors improving the performance of a SWIM weather application. In this context, and due to the autonomous nature of the UAVs, it is possible to embed autonomous decision-making tools in the software on-board the UAVs for providing services in the SWIM architecture. Furthermore, to increase the robustness of the system w.r.t. the communication infrastructure limitations, distributed autonomous decision tools are considered instead of centralized decision-making. An important issue in distributed multi-UAV coordination is the distributed task allocation problem that has recently become a key research topic. Our approach to the distributed task allocation problem considers the application of market-based negotiation rules. Based on this method, the UAVs themselves will autonomously decide which one will be endowed with each task. In the missions considered in the paper, a team of UAVs has to provide services to a SWIM application. Those services have been modeled by tasks consisting in visiting waypoints transmitting data in real time. The distributed execution of the algorithm applied in the paper will compute which UAV will visit each waypoint during the mission. Moreover, the algorithm will also create and allocate communication relay tasks if the limited communication range does not allow to send the data in real-time. The paper shows the result of several simulations considering different communication ranges.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 6th EUROCONTROL Innovative Research Workshop and Exhibition: Disseminating ATM Innovative Research; Conference date: 4 December 2007 through 6 December 2007; Conference code: 111416</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84926050392&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4a070b6a8c5ff9170d259976256245ae</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>EUROCONTROL Innov.

This could open the door to new exciting applications in earth observation, telecommunication or in-orbit servicing. Such missions are expected to have important benefits in terms of low system and deployment costs, distributed sensor capability or high reliability due to redundancy. In order to take advantage of a swarm configuration, a communication concept is required, which deals in a generic way with specific space environments and is able to cope with frequent topology changes. Up to now, space communication has only addressed static inter-satellite links (ISL), mainly based on proprietary protocols. In this paper, we propose to adopt well-known terrestrial communication standards. Such standards have been proven to be well conceived for a wide range of applications. WiFi is one prominent representative of such candidates which includes the ability of ad-hoc networking in order to provide decentralized and distributed wireless networks. Space specific requirements demand minor adaptions of the communication protocols. COTS components are also suitable for such protocols with minor changes. This paper studies these adaptions in depth, both in theory and by simulations and is therefore an important step towards its realization. To our knowledge, there is currently no suitable communication technology which has been adapted for swarm missions with small satellites. © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference; Conference date: 1 March 2014 through 8 March 2014; Conference code: 106118</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903973777&amp;doi=10.1109%2fAERO.2014.6836320&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f6b6e1dfadb381639b31b71c1553ea3d</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>IEEE Aerosp.

Vehicular Ad-hoc network (VANET) is an emerging technology where vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-toinfrastructure (V2I) communicate wirelessly using dedicated short-range communication band. In sensor based VANET (S-VANET) issues like response time, data aging, bandwidth, packet delivery, message prioritization and communication cost is a major concern. In this paper, we apply cognitive security protocol that disseminates information using distributed sensor technology while prioritizing prevention of data aging, efficient quality-of-service (QoS) and robustness against denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The reliability and optimality of the protocol is computed based on current mission response time and maintaining message authentication, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation. © 2009 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: R.

To address this problem, we propose a collaborative hierarchical Multi-Agent model based on two layers (Administrant layer and Autonomous layer), which makes use of the knowledge-based communication to actualize interaction in this model. Task planning and allocation are implemented in the administrant layer by using U-Tree algorithm, where reward function and evaluation value are introduced to control selection factors. Agents are allowed to work together using architectures like swarm and information update value in the autonomous layer, so that centralized and decentralized control can be integrated effectively. Moreover, this collaboration model has been applied successfully in CSU_Yunlu RoboCupRescue simulation team to show its advantages over other approaches, which will be about to participate in international RoboCupRescue 2006 in June. © 2006 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: P.
