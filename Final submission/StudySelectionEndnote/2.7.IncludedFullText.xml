The use of a group of UAVs instead of one single UAV offers many advantages like extending the mission coverage, providing a reliable ad-hoc networks services, and enhancing the service performance, to name a few. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of the swarm topology, the coordination of a large number of UAVs poses new challenges to traditional inter-UAV communication protocols. Therefore, there is a need for the design of new networking protocols that can efficiently support the fast-pace and real-time requirements of a coordinated swarm navigation in various environments. In this paper, we propose SEMRP a Swarm energy-efficient multicast routing protocol for UAVs flying in group formations. The main purpose of SEMRP is to facilitate the control and information delivery between UAVs while minimizing inter-UAV packet loss, packet re-transmission, and end-to-end delay. In this study we show how SEMRP achieves these objectives by taking into account various Quality-of-Service parameters like the network throughput, the UAVs mobility, and energy efficiency to ensure a timely and accurate information delivery to all members of a UAV swarm. The results of the conducted simulation using NS-2 advocate for the efficiency of our proposal through its to two presented versions (SEMRP-v1 and SEMRP-v2) in term of reducing the total emission energy (at least by 10 dBm), optimizing the End-to-End Delay by 44%, and increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), wireless communications, and image processing and classification technologies are combined for generating warnings to an operator in a search mission. Thus, the UAV would be used to cover a specific ground area communicating images the system should be able to classify. In case a positive image is classified (i.e., one with the object/s being searched for), an operator is warned so that the final decision is made by an expert. In this way, the mostly bored task of looking at images without object being looked for is avoided, and the expert attention could be focused on images with a high probability of having the object/s being looked for. A cloud service is used for image classification (IBM Watson) along with a previously proposed UAV system architecture and a low-cost drone SDK. A proof of concept is described, giving implementation details, and preliminary results. Obtained results show that the general system is a viable solution and set a starting point for enhancing several subsystems for better performance.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Not really architecture&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)</research-notes><custom3>2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

In these scenarios, deploying a UAV swarm instead of a single UAV can provide additional benefits when, for example, cargo carrying requirements exceed the lifting power of a single UAV, or when the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously can accelerate the accomplishment of the mission, and broaden the covered area. To this aim, in this paper we present MUSCOP, a protocol that allows multiple UAVs to perfectly coordinate their flight when performing planned missions. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is able to achieve a high degree of swarm cohesion independently of the swarm formation adopted, and even in the presence of very lossy channels, achieving minimal synchronization delays and very low position offsets with regard to the ideal case.</abstract><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49777/F.

In this paper we focus on using multiple UAVs to cooperatively monitor a crowded area. Communication in such UAVs network is an ongoing project. Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result. The class of the data as well as other relevant information about the detected event will be used by the GCS to authorize or not UAV data transmission and hence to optimize the bandwidth usage efficiency.

Recently, a UAV swarm service is getting a lot of attention since compared to the single UAV, a UAV swarm can reduce time of executing various mission activities such as remote sensing, surveillance, search and rescue. However, to support those UAV swarm service scenarios, UAV management system should be involved and moreover, the system requires a real-time data delivery feature due to the high cruise speed of the UAVs and the low-latency constraints of the command and control message. Considering oneM2M message flows, we have designed the procedure which enables real-time data delivery in oneM2M platform and experimental results show that our system improves end-to-end delay performance in various network environments.  2019 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers (IEIE).</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019 - January 25, 2019&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication (ICEIC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATION (ICEIC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019 - January 25, 2019</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/ELINFOCOM.2019.8706417</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Auckland, New zealand</custom1><custom3>18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019 - January 25, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

These types of missions are very complex and often involve systems that are not interoperable. From an operational perspective however, some level of integration is necessary. Typically, a common network system architecture and Situation Awareness (SA) platform are required. The architecture allows operators to transfer data between vehicles and their operators, while the SA platform allows to monitor mission progress and react to changes. This paper presents a network system architecture used during an experiment realized in Spring 2016 in Norway. 8 departments from 5 institutions worked together to combine operation of 4 UVs (aerial, surface, underwater), a support vessel and on-shore team. The description is followed by a backbone network performance analysis. Several cases are presented, with focus on a transmission between manned vessel and Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), including direct connection, and data-relay mechanism via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49787/A.

Based on the concept of modularity, the proposed architecture divides the overall system into five layers: 1) low-level control layer; 2) high-level control layer; 3) coordination layer; 4) communication layer; and 5) human interaction layer, and many modules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and outputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can be reduced but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale of 21 fixed-wing UAVs.

Aiming at this issue, this article is devoted to the design of the multi-UAV flight strategy to improve the cooperative search capability in an uncertain communication environment. Specifically, a new cooperative architecture oriented to a local communication network is devised to control the observation locations of multiple UAVs in the search process, and some local communication networks are established based on the distance among UAVs to meet the requirements of the search task. On this foundation, we develop a multi-UAV cooperative search model (MCSM) with communication cost and formation benefit as an optimization function to ensure the effectiveness of multi-UAV search. Moreover, in the process of model solving, an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) is presented with some different search strategies to enhance the optimization capability. To verify the superiority of the proposed method, we designed several groups of simulation experiments to analyze the performance of MCSM. Experimental results illustrate that our method can not only maintain high cooperative search accuracy but also has high stability and convergence speed.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;More about an algorithm than an architecture&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The search protocol, the UAV Search Mission Protocol (USMP), combines inter-UAV communication with geographic routing to improve search efficiency in terms of total searches, distance traveled by UAVs, and the minimization of UAV direction changes. By determining where search state updates impact search decisions, messages are geographically routed to improve search efficiency. USMP and the geographic greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) protocol are studied via simulation using OPNET Modeler 12.0. Geographic routing degrades performance by at least 20% in total searches and distance traveled, but improves direction changes by 6.7%. Overall, USMP improves performance by as much as 188% compared to scenarios without inter-UAV communication.

Swarms of UAVs may further increase the effectiveness of these tasks, since they enable larger coverage, more accurate or redundant sensed data, fault tolerance, etc. Swarms of aerial robots require real-time coordination, which is just a specific case of M2M collaboration. But one of the biggest challenges of UAV swarming is that this real-time coordination has to happen in a wide-area setting where it is expensive, or even impossible, to set up a dedicated wireless infrastructure for this purpose. Instead, one has to resort to conventional 3G/4G wireless networks, where communication latencies are in the range of 50-150 ms. In this paper we tackle the problem of UAV swarm formation and maintenance in areas covered by such mobile network, and propose a bandwidth-efficient multi-robot coordination algorithm for these settings. The coordination algorithm was implemented on the top of our mobile middleware SDDL, uses its group-cast communication capability, and was tested with simulated UAVs.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)</research-notes><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

Failure to communicate remotely sensed mission data to the base may render the system ineffective, and the inability to exchange command and control messages can lead to system failures. This paper describes a unique method to control communications through distributed task allocation to engage under-utilized UAVs to serve as communication relays and to ensure that the network supports mission tasks. The distributed algorithm uses task assignment information, including task location and proposed execution time, to predict the network topology and plan support using relays. By explicitly coupling task assignment and relay creation processes the team is able to optimize the use of agents to address the needs of dynamic complex missions. The framework is designed to consider realistic network communication dynamics including path loss, stochastic fading, and information routing. The planning strategy is shown to ensure that agents support both datarate and interconnectivity bit-error-rate requirements during task execution. System performance is characterized through experiments both in simulation and in outdoor flight testing with a team of three UAVs.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49785/A.

The resource constraints and dynamic nature of the swarm bring critical challenges to the design of UAV routing protocols. Most of the conventional ad hoc routing schemes are not intelligent and cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of UAV swarming networks. On the other hand, some artificial intelligence (AI)-based routing schemes may consume significant computational resources in the UAVs. In this article, a low-cost, adaptive routing protocol, namely skeleton-based swarm routing (SSR), is proposed, which exploits an intelligent online learning algorithm and the topology features of the mission-driven UAV swarm to distribute the traffic over optimal routes. Here, the skeleton represents the most stable parts of the swarm formation. SSR architecture consists of three modules: 1) A geometric addressing module, which assigns geometric coordinates to each node based on the swarm skeleton structure; 2) A leaf-like routing pipe which allows the selection of multiple candidate routes around the shortest path; 3) An intelligent low-complexity learning model which determines how to distribute the packets inside the routing pipe to achieve load-balanced, high-throughput transmissions. The proposed skeleton-based scheme can also facilitate the UAV formation construction and morphing. The simulation results show that the proposed SSR protocol can noticeably improve the network performance (up to 100% throughput improvement) compared to the single path routing schemes, such as the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and link-quality and traffic-load aware optimized link state routing (LTA-OLSR) protocols.

Hence, the cloud-based computation offloading is widely adopted, nevertheless, for some latency-sensitive tasks, e.g., object recognition, path planning, etc., the cloud-based manner is inappropriate due to the excessive delay. Even in some harsh environments, e.g., disaster area, battlefield, etc., there is no wireless infrastructure existed to combine the drones and cloud center. Thus, to solve the problem encountered by cloud-based computation offloading, in this paper, Fog Computing aided Swarm of Drones (FCSD) architecture is proposed. Considering the uncertainty factors in harsh environments which may threaten the success of FCSD processing tasks, not only the latency model, but also the reliability model of FCSD is constructed to guarantee the high reliability of task completion. Moreover, in view of the limited battery life of the drone, we formulated the problem as the task allocation problem which minimized the energy consumption of FCSD under the constraints of latency and reliability. Furthermore, to speed up the process of the optimization problem solving to improve the practicality, relying on the recent advances in distributed convex optimization, we develop a fast Proximal Jacobi Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based distributed algorithm. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</abstract><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49797/X.

An autonomous fleet of cooperating UAVs can render more efficient and robust ability to complete the missions. In order to make multiple UAVs fly cooperatively in an autonomous way without control from the ground station, one of the key techniques is communication network technology. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to construct a clustered-backbone to support both broadcast and unicast communications for UAV networks. In our algorithm, UAVs clustering and virtual backbone construction only need the information exchange among adjacent UAVs. We also propose a strategy to dynamically maintain this clustered-backbone network.

Although a great deal of emphasis has been placed on the drone-assisted networks, existing work focuses on routing protocols without fully exploiting the drones superiority and flexibility. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a collaborative communication scheme for multiple drones to assist the urban vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). In this scheme, drones are distributed regarding the predicted terrestrial traffic condition in order to efficiently alleviate the inevitable problems of conventional VANETs, such as building obstacle, isolated vehicles, and uneven traffic loading. To effectively coordinate multiple drones, this issue is modeled as a multimodal optimization problem to improve the global performance on a certain space. To this end, a succinct swarm-based optimization algorithm, namely Multimodal Nomad Algorithm (MNA) is presented. This algorithm is inspired by the migratory behavior of the nomadic tribes on Mongolia grassland. Based on the floating car data of Chengdu China, extensive experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the MNA-optimized drone-assisted VANET. The results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of hop number, packet delivery ratio, and throughput.</abstract><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49793/N.

In this paper we present a project that focuses on incidents, that are caused by uncontrolled emissions of liquid or gaseous contaminants (e.g. explosive or toxic gases or liquids, biological, chemical or nuclear weapons). Instead of sending specially equipped forces with expensive transport and measurement devices into the contaminated area, our proposed system makes use of an autonomous, wireless connected swarm of Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAV), often simply known as drones, that are featured with lightweight mobile sensor systems. In this paper we will be particularly focusing on the complex communication system, which on the one hand has to organize the on-board-communication between the control systems of the MUAV and the sensors and on the other hand has to establish wireless connections to the mission control center on the ground as well as to neighboring MUAVs in the air via a mesh network.

If the data under consideration is an emergency message such as a fire alarm, it must be transmitted as fast and reliably as possible towards the sink of WSN. In such mission critical applications, it may not be enough to have one static sink but there will be multiple and mobile sinks. Sinks can be associated to first responders such as firefighters, but also to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The existing approaches have a high communication cost and a high delivery latency, which makes them less suitable for emergency situations. As an alternative to existing protocols, we present Honeycomb Architecture and Hexagonal Tiling-Based Data Dissemination (HexDD) protocol for emergency message transmission in mobile multi-sink WSNs. Simulation results show that HexDD has a high data delivery ratio and a very low data delivery latency, which are major requirements for disaster management scenarios.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 The 9th IFIP Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 The 9th IFIP Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)&#xD;&#xD;UAVs are only tackled on the side&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49786/A.

The large number of small vehicles motivates novel design choices for state estimation and communication. For state estimation, we develop a method to reliably track many small rigid bodies with identical motion-capture marker arrangements. Our communication infrastructure uses compressed one-way data flow and supports a large number of vehicles per radio. We achieve reliable flight with accurate tracking (&lt; 2 cm mean position error) by implementing the majority of computation onboard, including sensor fusion, control, and some trajectory planning. We provide various examples and empirically determine latency and tracking performance for swarms with up to 49 vehicles.

The dynamic task assignment model for the UAV swarm with the topology of distributed subsets is established considering multiple constraints such as task cooperation, performing sequence, dynamic environment, communication topology, payload model, and UAV capability. According to the characteristics of multi-participants and multi-tasks in the process of UAV swarm executing tasks, the determination mechanism on cooperators and the selection mechanism of sequential tasks are proposed, and then the contract network protocol is extended. On the basis of the above, an event-triggered task assignment strategy for dynamic tasks is designed. The simulated results show that the proposed method can achieve the cooperative dynamic assignment of the UAV swarm to perform reconnaissance-and-attack tasks to multi-targets in complex and uncertain combat scenarios, improve the adaptiveness of the swarm under the sudden circumstance, and realize the optimization for task execution efficiency of the UAV swarm.

This paper proposes a decentralized UAV swarm persistent monitoring strategy in realizing continuous sensing coverage and network service. A two-layer (high altitude and low altitude) UAV teaming hierarchical structure is adopted in realizing the accurate object tracking in the area of interest (AOI). By introducing the UAV communication channel model in its path planning, both centralized and decentralized control schemes would be evaluated in the waypoint tracking simulation. The UAV swarm network service and object tracking are measured by metrics of communication link quality and waypoints tracking accuracy. UAV swarm network connectivity are evaluated over different aspects, such as stability and volatility. The comparison of proposed algorithms is presented with simulations. The result shows that the decentralized scheme outperforms the centralized scheme in the mission of persistent surveillance, especially on maintaining the stability of inner UAV swarm network while tracking moving objects.

Its purpose is to carry out complex missions involving Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Suppression of Enemy Aerial Defenses (SEAD), Destruction of Enemy Aerial Defenses (DEAD), Close Air Support (CAS), and other functions in an environment characterized by large uncertainty and vehicle loss or failures. Our approach is referred to as the Collaborative Mission Planning &amp; Autonomous Control Technology (CoMPACT) encompassing tasks and objectives from the mission planning stage to the UAV task execution level. The main advantage of the CoMPACT system is that it effectively combines mission planning using evolutionary algorithms, hybrid automata-based task execution, and biologically-inspired emergent swarm behaviors. Judicious combination and coordination of these capabilities results in a system that is scalable to architectures involving a very large number of autonomous agents in which mission-relevant objectives are accomplished in highly uncertain dynamic environments through real-time mission re-planning, dynamic agent-to-task assignment, and reactive motion planning. Through simulation and experiment, the CoMPACT approach is shown to be robust to intermittent loss of communications and communication delays, and to dynamic changes in the environment such as moving targets, unknown targets and obstacles, pop-up threats, vehicular failures and loss of agents. The CoMPACT system has been extensively tested on a Matlab simulation of a realistic mission scenario involving ISR, SEAD and DEAD functions, and simple models of UAV dynamics operating in a dynamic threat and target-rich environment. The CoMPACT system has also been implemented and field tested for maritime applications in a companion AUVSI paper [42].</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: R.

Each UAV in the team uses inertial sensor and terrain sensor information to simultaneously localise the UAV while building a point feature map of the surrounding terrain, where map information is shared between vehicles over a data fusion network. Multi-vehicle active SLAM control architectures are proposed that actively plan the trajectories and motions of each of the vehicles in the team based on maximising information in the localisation and mapping estimates. We demonstrate and compare an ideal, centralised architecture, where a central planning node chooses optimal actions for each UAV, and a coordinated, decentralised architecture, where UAVs make their own control decisions based on common shared map information. The different architectures involve varying degrees of complexity and optimality through differing communications and computational requirements. Results are presented using a three-UAV team in a six-degree of freedom multi-UAV simulator.

For instance, utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for aerial imagery data helps to get a real-time monitoring system of the stricken areas. Recently, UAV is becoming a ubiquitous system and valuable technology in many civil applications, motivating researchers to endeavor to develop UAVs systems. Moreover, Internet of Things (IoT) has been employed to several study cases of disaster response. Using IoT to communicate, manage and control multiple UAVs after disaster occurrence is a real practical approach. However, this kind of integration wasnt clearly presented especially in the technical sides like communication and autonomous control. Consequently, this paper aims to reveal the scientific scenes of communications and controls between multiple UAVs and Ground Control Stations (GCSs). Due to an unexpected failure within a single UAV system, this study presents a multi-UAV system for scanning and tracking missions. Authors turned UAV to an IoT device by using embedded LTE dongle on the UAV control board. In the beginning of the paper, authors raised the issues of existing systems. Then, presented the design and process of the proposed system. Lastly, they demonstrated some results through experiments.

Traditional single-UAV mission reliability modeling methods have been unable to meet the requirements of UAV swarm mission reliability modeling. Therefore, the UAV swarm mission reliability modeling and evaluation method is proposed. First, aimed at the interdependence among the multiple layers, a multi-layer network model of a UAV swarm is established. At the same time, based on the system having the following characteristics?using a mission chain to complete the mission and applying the connectivity of the mission network?the mission network model of a UAV swarm is established. Second, vulnerability and connectivity are selected as two indicators to reflect the reliability of the mission, and aimed at random attack and deliberate attack, vulnerability and connectivity evaluation methods are proposed. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the constructed model are verified through simulations,and the model and selected indicators can meet the reliability requirements of the UAV swarm mis-sion. In this way, this study provides quantitative reference for UAV-swarm-related decision -making work and supports the development of UAV-swarm-related work.
