Since the GCS belongs to the central control architecture, the edge computing system of the distributed architecture gives the drones more flexibility in dealing with changing environmental conditions, allowing them to autonomously and instantly plan their flight path, fly in formation, or even avoid obstacles. Broadcast communications are used to realize UAV-to-UAV communications for allocating tasks among a swarm of UAVs and ensuring each individual collaborates as an integrated member of the group. The dynamic path programming problem for the UAV swarm mission uses a 2-phase Tabu search with the 2-Opt exchange method and A∗ search as the path programming algorithm. Distance is taken as a cost function for path programming. We then increase and expand the turning-points of no-fly zones based on drone fleet coverage, thus preventing drones from entering prohibited areas. Whereas previous work mostly only considers single no-fly zones, this approach accounts for multiple restricted areas, ensuring that a UAV swarm can complete its assigned task without violating no-fly zones. A drone encountering an obstacle while traveling along the route set by the algorithm will update the map information in real-time, allowing for an instant recharting of the optimal path to the goal as a reverse search using the D∗ Lite algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 3rd IEEE Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering, ECICE 2021; Conference date: 29 October 2021 through 31 October 2021; Conference code: 175835&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 3rd IEEE Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering, ECICE 2021, October 29, 2021 - October 31, 2021&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE 3rd Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc.

The FANET task allocation problem is one-to-one assignment of agents to tasks so that the overall benefit of all the agents is maximized by taking delays and costs into account, given a set of agents and a set of tasks. A coordination based task allocation system ensuring spatial and temporal coordination between UAVs is essential for FANETs. In this paper, a new multi UAV task planning heuristic is proposed for FANETs to visit all target points in a minimum time, while preserving all time network connectivity. Effectiveness in the mission execution and cost efficiency in the task allocation have been presented by conducting a bunch of experiments performed on 2D terrains.

UAVs may also be used as mobile aerial Base Station (BS) for maintaining the communication in emergency scenarios. The millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, including the sub-THz frequencies above 100 GHz, are an attractive technology for high data rate UAV connectivity due to the wide bandwidths available at these frequencies. This paper studies antenna and codebook design for UAV communication at both 28 and 140 GHz with realistic antenna simulations and flight patterns. The analysis shows that multi-array configurations with proper codebook design are necessary for uniform spherical coverage and become particularly important in long range applications. The paper thus proposes a four array design with patch antennas. Simulations indicate that the design can achieve in excess of 1 Gbps data rates at a range of 1 km, with reasonable power levels and moderate rain fades. A simulation with a real public safety mission flight shows that beam tracking can be maintained even under high drone movements and rotations.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)</research-notes><custom3>2020 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Within this field, solutions where several UAVs team-up to create a swarm are gaining momentum as they enable to perform more sophisticated tasks, or accelerate task execution compared to the single-UAV alternative. However, advanced solutions based on UAV swarms still lack significant advancements and validation in real environments to facilitate their adoption and deployment. In this paper we take a step ahead in this direction by proposing a solution that improves the resilience of swarm flights, focusing on handling the loss of the swarm leader, which is typically the most critical condition to be faced. Experiments using our UAV emulation tool (ArduSim) evidence the correctness of the protocol under adverse circumstances, and highlight that swarm members are able to seamlessly switch to an alternative leader when necessary, introducing a negligible delay in the process in most cases, while keeping this delay within a few seconds even in worst-case conditions.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49791/J.

Having meshed interconnection, a swarm maintains a communication network dedicated for applications with context-dependent performance requirements that require reliable traffic classification and conditioning. Nevertheless, these systems are vulnerable because UAVs/UGVs may act incorrectly resulting in an erroneous network behavior which may affect the performance of mission-critical flows. This is a major problem if a couple of untrusted UAVs and UGVs from different rescue organizations are connected. In this paper, the reliability of traffic conditioning within untrusted swarms is enhanced by the Distributed Flow Permission Inspection (DiFPIN) scheme. DiFPIN is used to verify the flow classification to circumvent the usage of erroneous entities on the transmission path. Thereby, the negative impairment of mission-critical flows can be reduced.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)</research-notes><custom3>2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

The use of a group of UAVs instead of one single UAV offers many advantages like extending the mission coverage, providing a reliable ad-hoc networks services, and enhancing the service performance, to name a few. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of the swarm topology, the coordination of a large number of UAVs poses new challenges to traditional inter-UAV communication protocols. Therefore, there is a need for the design of new networking protocols that can efficiently support the fast-pace and real-time requirements of a coordinated swarm navigation in various environments. In this paper, we propose SEMRP a Swarm energy-efficient multicast routing protocol for UAVs flying in group formations. The main purpose of SEMRP is to facilitate the control and information delivery between UAVs while minimizing inter-UAV packet loss, packet re-transmission, and end-to-end delay. In this study we show how SEMRP achieves these objectives by taking into account various Quality-of-Service parameters like the network throughput, the UAVs mobility, and energy efficiency to ensure a timely and accurate information delivery to all members of a UAV swarm. The results of the conducted simulation using NS-2 advocate for the efficiency of our proposal through its to two presented versions (SEMRP-v1 and SEMRP-v2) in term of reducing the total emission energy (at least by 10 dBm), optimizing the End-to-End Delay by 44%, and increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol.  © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 17; Conference name: 24th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications, DS-RT 2020; Conference date: 14 September 2020 through 16 September 2020; Conference code: 163757&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 24th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications, DS-RT 2020, September 14, 2020 - September 16, 2020&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc.

Intelligent swarm systems are very efficient at solving group-level problems and their capability to accomplish complex missions with no or little human intervention. One of the most challenging problems is operating in environments with surrounding obstacles such as buildings, thus, often obstructing inter-UAV communication. A UAV swarm is required to maintain continuous communication between its members and preserve the stability of its formation while flying towards an ultimate goal. In this paper we propose MSCS, a new cooperative and adaptive scheme for multi-clustered autonomous UAV swarms. This schemes allows several UAVs operating in a swarm formation to coordinate their navigation and path planning operations by using an adaptive multi-clustered leader-follower approach. The swarm members follow a dynamically elected leader based on the UAV with best fit to lead the swarm towards the destination. The coordination of the UAVs is achieved through SBP (Swarm Broadcast Protocol), a single-hop broadcast UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication protocol, which allows swarm members to exchange information about their current location and their local cluster leader. We present a set of performance results, which show that this scheme contributes efficiently at maintaining the swarm formation's stability at acceptable density and disconnection ratio. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9; Conference name: 16th IEEE&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2020; Conference date: 15 June 2020 through 19 June 2020; Conference code: 162085&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 16th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2020, June 15, 2020 - June 19, 2020&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 16TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE, IWCMC&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), wireless communications, and image processing and classification technologies are combined for generating warnings to an operator in a search mission. Thus, the UAV would be used to cover a specific ground area communicating images the system should be able to classify. In case a positive image is classified (i.e., one with the object/s being searched for), an operator is warned so that the final decision is made by an expert. In this way, the mostly bored task of looking at images without object being looked for is avoided, and the expert attention could be focused on images with a high probability of having the object/s being looked for. A cloud service is used for image classification (IBM Watson) along with a previously proposed UAV system architecture and a low-cost drone SDK. A proof of concept is described, giving implementation details, and preliminary results. Obtained results show that the general system is a viable solution and set a starting point for enhancing several subsystems for better performance.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Not really architecture&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)</research-notes><custom3>2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

In these scenarios, deploying a UAV swarm instead of a single UAV can provide additional benefits when, for example, cargo carrying requirements exceed the lifting power of a single UAV, or when the deployment of several UAVs simultaneously can accelerate the accomplishment of the mission, and broaden the covered area. To this aim, in this paper we present MUSCOP, a protocol that allows multiple UAVs to perfectly coordinate their flight when performing planned missions. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is able to achieve a high degree of swarm cohesion independently of the swarm formation adopted, and even in the presence of very lossy channels, achieving minimal synchronization delays and very low position offsets with regard to the ideal case.</abstract><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49777/F.

To enhance the received signal power and avoid frequent signal collision, RADMA (Rotational Angle Division Multiple Access) has been proposed. In RADMA, a UAV-BS (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Base Station) equipped with ULA (Uniformly Linear Array antenna) is deployed as the mobile data collector, To improve the performance of RADMA when serving a larger area, it is required to design an effective trajectory to dynamically deploy the UAV-BS within the area. In this paper, a simple UAV-BS trajectory decision method based on sectorized K-means clustering is proposed to provide uniform QoS (Quality-of-Service) among all SNs. First, the area is sectorized with equal sector size. Then, the initial centroid coordinate of each cluster is randomly generated within each sector area to avoid biased centroids. Finally, the trajectory is formed by connecting the centroids of the SNs clusters. The numerical results have validated that combining RADMA with sectorized k-means clustering-based trajectory enables all SNs to transmit all the data within a predetermined mission time and with low transmission energy.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)</research-notes><custom3>2020 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

In this paper we focus on using multiple UAVs to cooperatively monitor a crowded area. Communication in such UAVs network is an ongoing project. Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result. The class of the data as well as other relevant information about the detected event will be used by the GCS to authorize or not UAV data transmission and hence to optimize the bandwidth usage efficiency. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 22; Conference name: 15th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2019; Conference date: 24 June 2019 through 28 June 2019; Conference code: 149875&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 15th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2019, June 24, 2019 - June 28, 2019&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 15th International Wireless Communications &amp; Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 15TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &amp; MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

These systems, because of the many sensors and actuators they can embed, are suitable for autonomous missions in 3D (Dull, Dirty and Dangerous) environments for instance. However, embedding a large number of capabilities in all of members of a swarm is expensive in terms of cost, weight and energy consumption. Thus, it is usually more efficient to embed only a single or a few capabilities within each UMS. It then becomes necessary to provide a discovery mechanism built into the swarm in order to allow its members to share their capabilities and to collaborate for achieving a global mission. These shared capabilities are called services. In this paper, we propose a new service discovery system called AMiRALE for Asynchronous Missions Relay for Autonomous and Lively Entities dedicated to highly volatile, autonomous and mobile swarms of UMS. Our solution is independent of both nodes' mobility and connectivity patterns. Moreover, it supports heterogeneous swarms and degraded conditions of operation (i.e., Message loss, UMS loss and disconnected network). It is also totally decentralized and enables both discovery and service usage. We provide a description of the theoretical model of our AMiRALE system as well as several simulation results obtained from a park cleaning scenario.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49796/V.

Logistics companies especially keep trying to utilize drones for fast delivery following the growing market size of e-commerce. Accordingly, methods for safely operating multi-drone have been researched, and many researchers have proposed various optimal or near-optimal routing methods. However, such methods have some problems that cause routing failures or huge routing computation time in a drone-dense space due to many collisions. In this paper, we propose a centralized framework that deals with enormous collisions and obtains collision-free paths rapidly. We first build a drone energy consumption model with a data-driven method using flight experiment data of a commercial drone to estimate the drone battery state-of-charge (SoC). Then, we develop a novel routing method that generates collision-free paths by considering both the congestion of the space and the SoC of each drone. The proposed method is inspired by the VLSI circuit routing method that connects all signal nets among thousands of logic components. Through numerous delivery routing simulations, we confirm that the proposed method achieves a maximum of 6 times higher routing success rate with a 10x faster runtime compared with the state-of-the-art optimal method. In addition, we validate that the proposed method is applicable to delivery routing problems with various drone battery capacities.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

While the multi-UAV systems have a great potential in many different scenarios, increasing complexity of missions gave raise to a new set of problems. Some of them include high workload periods of a single operator supervising multiple agents, loss of the situation awareness, increased amount of the data generated by the system and problems in communication channels between the operator and UAVs. All of them could lead to performance degradation in the mission execution or even critical failures of system elements. In general, there are two aspects that help to avoid or at least to decrease mentioned problems - mission planning and human-machine interface (HMI) design. In this paper, we mainly address the mission planning aspect and only briefly present an HMI design that allows simultaneous handling of three UAVs in civil infrastructure data acquisition missions. The proposed interface, among the standard telemetry data, includes data download/upload from/to external services, a trajectory planner and the acquired data representation. The proposed architecture has been tested in a simulation and in a real environment.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2021; Conference date: 15 June 2021 through 18 June 2021; Conference code: 170495&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2021, June 15, 2021 - June 18, 2021&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

Off-the-shelf drone products accessible at reasonable costs are enabling new applications and research directions from crowd management, product delivery, and smart cities to security and military applications. The potential of autonomous swarm missions opens up new research avenues; however, off-the-shelf drone products, as well as most commercial projects, lack features that are required by autonomous collective multi drone missions. One potential reason is that there is no consensus on how to develop drones with cooperative operation capacity systemically. This study suggests a generalized device architecture concerning both hardware and software organization to aid developers of cooperative drones designed for multi-drone missions. The proposed architecture grants autonomy and cooperation within a swarm. An additional solution is also provided to enable ad-hoc networking for drones when the drone platform does not natively support it.

Recently, a UAV swarm service is getting a lot of attention since compared to the single UAV, a UAV swarm can reduce time of executing various mission activities such as remote sensing, surveillance, search and rescue. However, to support those UAV swarm service scenarios, UAV management system should be involved and moreover, the system requires a real-time data delivery feature due to the high cruise speed of the UAVs and the low-latency constraints of the command and control message. Considering oneM2M message flows, we have designed the procedure which enables real-time data delivery in oneM2M platform and experimental results show that our system improves end-to-end delay performance in various network environments.  2019 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers (IEIE).</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019 - January 25, 2019&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication (ICEIC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATION (ICEIC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019 - January 25, 2019</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/ELINFOCOM.2019.8706417</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Auckland, New zealand</custom1><custom3>18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019 - January 25, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

Aiming at solving low computational efficiency and poor scalability of the traditional multi-UAV path planning method, the decentralized multi-UAV path planning method suitable for obstacle environments is proposed. Firstly, the UAV rendezvous path planning problem with constraints such as the kinematics of UAVs and collision-free constraints is modeled as a non-convex optimal control problem. To minimize formation rendezvous time and energy consumption, a two-layer coordinative framework is developed to solve this problem. In the coordination layer, relying only on the information of neighboring UAVs, each UAV in the decentralized communication graph negotiates the desired flight time using a consensus protocol to achieve coordination among UAVs. In the planning layer, the initial non-convex formation rendezvous path planning problem is decoupled into several sub-problems, which can be solved in parallel by path planners distributed on each UAV using sequential convex programming. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results show that this decentralized multi-UAV path planning method can handle the minimum-time rendezvous path planning problem and optimize the energy consumption in flight, and the computing time does not increase significantly with the enlargement of the UAV swarm. This decentralized framework scales well with the number of UAVs and can be applied for future urban flight and supplies delivery tasks.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: Z.

The use of UAVs promises great potentials in finding missing persons during maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions. Hereby, communication between ground station and vehicle is essential in order to exchange data. Mandatory requirements are high reliability - especially for telemetry and control data - as well as high data rates as an enabler for high resolution thermal imaging and real-time video payloads. The underlying paper investigates the applicability of Long Term Evolution (LTE) for maritime SAR missions. Therefore, in a first step, a detailed maritime channel model is developed and implemented. The analytic evaluations show significant decreases in communication range in dependency of UAV flight and base station height and in dependency of the current wind speed. To compensate interferences and frequency-dependent propagation effects the authors propose the aggregation of multiple LTE links using the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol. The proposed multi-link concept is evaluated and assessed in a close-to-reality evaluation. Hereby, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiment is conducted emulating a public mobile network operator in combination with a dedicated SAR-mission-only LTE link. The experiments highlight the applicability of LTE and MPTCP for maritime SAR missions. The heterogeneous multilink concept increases UAV communication range and achieves high reliability and data rates in the whole search area.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)</research-notes><custom3>2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

With the growing size of the UAV swarm in complex missions, it becomes a challenge to control them for efficient execution of missions. In a traditional centralized communication model where all UAVs in the swarm are controlled directly through ground control, channel capacity limits the number of UAVs in the swarm which restricts the scalability. In the context of low-power miniature drones, we limit the communication of the ground Base Station (gBS) with only one UAV (leader) which controls the rest of the UAVs (followers). Towards this, we propose a greedy heuristic method for selecting the UAV leader that requires minimal time to communicate with the gBS in real-time. The proposed master-slave model enhances the scalability of the swarm by improving the utilization of channel resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic leader selection enhances the lifetime of the entire network with a multifold decrease in energy consumption, compared to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the lifetime of the network also decreases on operating with a single UAV leader. We also observe reductions in delays by almost 60% and an increase in data rate by 50%. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2021; Conference date: 7 December 2021 through 11 December 2021; Conference code: 176805&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2021, December 7, 2021 - December 11, 2021&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Glob.

Multi-drone missions based on the existing ROS-based communication architecture heavily depend on the master node, and communication delay between nodes might not be sufficient for efficient inter-agent collision avoidance. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid ROS-ROS2 communication architecture for centralised traffic management with the provision of distributed communication for collision avoidance and conflict resolution at intersections. The base station server responsible for traffic management runs on a ROS2 environment, ROS is used for communication with each onboard autopilot, and an intermediate add-on-module interfaces ROS and ROS2 messages. The content of the communication packets between the different nodes is decided based on the design requirements. Overall communication architecture is validated through simulation and hardware experiments.  © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

Autonomous vehicles must embed the capabilities to supervise their behaviour and to detect and react to such events. The complexity increases with the heterogeneity of vehicles in the team and the communication constraints. This paper describes the Robot System Onboard Architecture (RSOA) software developed in the SWARMs project for the achievement of offshore maritime operations. This generic and modular architecture implements high level capabilities in a semiautonomous or autonomous manner, and is deployed at a lower level on a heterogeneous swarm of vehicles. Target vehicles include autonomous and teleoperated underwater vehicles, and surface vehicles. Simulation and experimentations achieved on the Black Sea in Romania (July 2017) then in the Trondheim fjord in Norway (June 2018) highlighted the good performance of the RSOA. © 2018 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 2018 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Workshop, AUV 2018; Conference date: 6 November 2018 through 9 November 2018; Conference code: 148644&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Workshop (AUV)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Workshop, AUV 2018, November 6, 2018 - November 9, 2018&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/OES AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE WORKSHOP (AUV)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: AUV - IEEE/OES Auton.

Mission planning for effective cooperative UAV searching must take into account the connectivity of UAVs for information sharing among UAVs in the FANET. Traditional mission planning usually uses predefined routes or use simple mobility models to generate the trajectories of UAVs, which do not take network connectivity as an important factor for high-quality cooperative searching. On the other hand, many innovative FANET mobility models have been investigated only for FANET simulation. In this paper, we propose a framework applying a recent group mobility model to mission planning with consideration on the network connectivity. For this purpose, we extend the Spatiotemporally Correlated Group Mobility Model (STGM) with adaptivity on its parameters that decide the spatial or temporal correlations among UAVs. Next, we introduce an area information coverage metric to evaluate the quality of mission planning enhanced by this adaptive mobility model. Finally, an algorithm is designed to optimize the metric. The experimental results show that our framework gains impressive improvements on effective information collection by the UAV swarm.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing &amp; Communications, Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing, Social Computing &amp; Networking, Sustainable Computing &amp; Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing &amp; Communications, Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing, Social Computing &amp; Networking, Sustainable Computing &amp; Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)</research-notes><custom3>2018 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing with Applications, Ubiquitous Computing &amp; Communications, Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing, Social Computing &amp; Networking, Sustainable Computing &amp; Communications (ISPA/IUCC/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

Swarm intelligent systems are not only efficient at solving group-level problems, but also decentralized, controllable by few simple parameters, making possible the command and control of UAV swarms by a single operator. Four separate but related projects are surveyed that explore the command and control of UAV swarms. Each project employs the DDDAS paradigm, entailing the ability of an executing application to incorporate dynamic data into the decision process, and conversely, to steer the measurement process via a central application system. By providing an overview of DDDAS approaches to UAV swarm mission scheduling, UAV swarm communication, UAV swarm formation planning, and flocking applications, general principles of UAV swarms and DDDAS architecture may be observed. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 32; Conference name: 2013 43rd Winter Simulation Conference - Simulation: Making Decisions in a Complex World, WSC 2013; Conference date: 8 December 2013 through 11 December 2013; Conference code: 102726&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 43rd Winter Simulation Conference - Simulation: Making Decisions in a Complex World, WSC 2013, December 8, 2013 - December 11, 2013&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc.

These types of missions are very complex and often involve systems that are not interoperable. From an operational perspective however, some level of integration is necessary. Typically, a common network system architecture and Situation Awareness (SA) platform are required. The architecture allows operators to transfer data between vehicles and their operators, while the SA platform allows to monitor mission progress and react to changes. This paper presents a network system architecture used during an experiment realized in Spring 2016 in Norway. 8 departments from 5 institutions worked together to combine operation of 4 UVs (aerial, surface, underwater), a support vessel and on-shore team. The description is followed by a backbone network performance analysis. Several cases are presented, with focus on a transmission between manned vessel and Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), including direct connection, and data-relay mechanism via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49787/A.

Moreover, since UAV's energy constrained, it will be a good measure to take multiple UAVs to collect data from devices in large areas. In this paper, we investigate multi-UAV collaborative data collection system, where multiple UAVs collect data from two-dimensional distributed devices on flying mode or hovering mode. The objective is to minimize UAVs' total flight time while allowing each device to complete data upload successfully with limited energy. To this end, firstly, a cell partition based on Voronoi diagram is used to allocate the collection areas of each UAV. Then, in each associated area, UAV determines the whole trajectory to serve devices. Lastly, given load requirement of ground devices and energy limitation, the optimal data collection mode of each device is decided to minimize flight time of each UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-UAV data collection scheme can shorten collection task completion time significantly.  2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC 2020, May 25, 2020 - May 28, 2020&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC 2020, May 25, 2020 - May 28, 2020</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120646</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Seoul, Korea, Republic of</custom1><custom3>2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC 2020, May 25, 2020 - May 28, 2020</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

Based on the concept of modularity, the proposed architecture divides the overall system into five layers: 1) low-level control layer; 2) high-level control layer; 3) coordination layer; 4) communication layer; and 5) human interaction layer, and many modules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and outputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can be reduced but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale of 21 fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work which successfully demonstrates formation flight, target recognition, and tracking missions within an integrated architecture for fixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: X.

Aiming at this issue, this article is devoted to the design of the multi-UAV flight strategy to improve the cooperative search capability in an uncertain communication environment. Specifically, a new cooperative architecture oriented to a local communication network is devised to control the observation locations of multiple UAVs in the search process, and some local communication networks are established based on the distance among UAVs to meet the requirements of the search task. On this foundation, we develop a multi-UAV cooperative search model (MCSM) with communication cost and formation benefit as an optimization function to ensure the effectiveness of multi-UAV search. Moreover, in the process of model solving, an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) is presented with some different search strategies to enhance the optimization capability. To verify the superiority of the proposed method, we designed several groups of simulation experiments to analyze the performance of MCSM. Experimental results illustrate that our method can not only maintain high cooperative search accuracy but also has high stability and convergence speed.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;More about an algorithm than an architecture&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Within swarm formations, UAs must remain close enough to communicate their position to other swarm constituents while maintaining sufficient separation to avoid collision. We analyze the tension between these two separation considerations, comparing different communication protocols and trajectory planning algorithms. With these considerations, we demonstrate the impact of increased swarm sizes on swarm coherence. © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 2021 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference, ICNS 2021; Conference date: 19 April 2021 through 23 April 2021; Conference code: 169317&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Integr.

Since the lack of cellular connectivity is mostly experienced in rural zones, it is of mandatory importance to design solutions to manage cellular architectures tailored to such zones. To this aim, we consider a new cellular 5G architecture, where the Base Stations (BSs) are carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, we focus on the problem of planning the missions of the UAV-based BSs over the territory, with the goal of minimizing the energy consumed for moving the UAVs. After introducing the considered framework, which is based on a multi-period graph defined over a set of places and a set of Time Slots (TSs), we derive a simple algorithm, called GAUP, to solve the considered problem in a reasonable amount of time. Our results, obtained over a simple - yet representative - scenario, reveals that GAUP is able to efficiently manage the energy for moving the UAVs, while guaranteeing relatively low computation times.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 9th International Conference on the Network of the Future (NOF)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 9th International Conference on the Network of the Future (NOF)</research-notes><custom3>2018 9th International Conference on the Network of the Future (NOF)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The search protocol, the UAV Search Mission Protocol (USMP), combines inter-UAV communication with geographic routing to improve search efficiency in terms of total searches, distance traveled by UAVs, and the minimization of UAV direction changes. By determining where search state updates impact search decisions, messages are geographically routed to improve search efficiency. USMP and the geographic greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) protocol are studied via simulation using OPNET Modeler 12.0. Geographic routing degrades performance by at least 20% in total searches and distance traveled, but improves direction changes by 6.7%. Overall, USMP improves performance by as much as 188% compared to scenarios without inter-UAV communication. © 2009 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 30; Conference name: 7th Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications, PerCom 2009; Conference date: 9 March 2009 through 13 March 2009; Conference code: 77122&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Annu.

Considering communication is limited in both bandwidth and range in the real world, we propose a lightweight environment presentation method and an efficient cooperative exploration strategy. For lower bandwidth, each robot uses specific polytopes to maintain free space and to generate Super Frontier Information (SFI), which serves as the source for exploration decision-making. To reduce repeated exploration, we develop a mission-based protocol that drives robots to share collected information in stable rendezvous. We also design a complete path planning scheme for both centralized and decentralized cases. To validate that our framework is practical and generic, we present an extensive benchmark and deploy our system into multi-UGV and multi-UAV platforms. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: F.

Swarms of unmanned aerial systems can aid in multiple applications such as protecting humans in war or natural disasters, conditioning infrastructure or asset monitoring, acting on a target, or package/medical drug delivery applications. If a single swarm member becomes immobilized, the swarm can still complete its task – assuming it is correctly programmed. The design framework for swarms is a complex problem in today’s aviation industry. Factors such as the selection of drones, a means of communication type, architecture, and autonomous flight pattern are all difficult decisions. Early adaption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology seems promising to realize autonomous swarm navigation and control. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art swarm-based UAS and recommends specific types, modes of communication, architectures, and swarm patterns for particular applications.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (eIT)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (eIT)</research-notes><custom3>2022 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (eIT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Multi-UAV systems have been used in an increasing number of mission scenarios and routing protocols play a critical role in UAV network communications. It is now well established that unstable link quality and frequently changing network topology pose significant challenges for messages forwarding in UAV networks. Hence, traditional mobile ad-hoc network routing protocols do not fit well in UAV networks. In many UAV applications, the flight paths of UAVs are planned in advance before performing missions. The positions and motion information of UAVs are available through Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial sensors, which can be utilized to calculate the future positions of UAVs. Therefore, the future topology of the UAV network is also available. However, existing work does not take advantage of this information. Based on the trajectory, location and motion information of the UAVs, this paper proposes a future network topology-aware routing (FNTAR) protocol, which uses future location information to make superior routing decisions. Moreover, to mitigate data loss problems caused by unstable links and highly dynamic topology, FNTAR can forward messages to multiple excellent next-hop UAVs based on future network topology, and these UAVs can deliver messages to destinations faster. We implement FNTAR in the simulation experiment, the simulation results demonstrate that FNTAR can achieve lower latency and higher delivery ratio than DTNgeo protocol. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Conference name: 2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC 2020; Conference date: 25 May 2020 through 28 May 2020; Conference code: 161344&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Wireless Commun.

Swarms of UAVs may further increase the effectiveness of these tasks, since they enable larger coverage, more accurate or redundant sensed data, fault tolerance, etc. Swarms of aerial robots require real-time coordination, which is just a specific case of M2M collaboration. But one of the biggest challenges of UAV swarming is that this real-time coordination has to happen in a wide-area setting where it is expensive, or even impossible, to set up a dedicated wireless infrastructure for this purpose. Instead, one has to resort to conventional 3G/4G wireless networks, where communication latencies are in the range of 50-150 ms. In this paper we tackle the problem of UAV swarm formation and maintenance in areas covered by such mobile network, and propose a bandwidth-efficient multi-robot coordination algorithm for these settings. The coordination algorithm was implemented on the top of our mobile middleware SDDL, uses its group-cast communication capability, and was tested with simulated UAVs.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)</research-notes><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

Drones appeal to mission architects looking to extend the toolbox provided to operators performing challenging missions such as public safety operations. However, careful analysis of the operational context and concept of operations must take place before major acquisitions. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model-based operational architecture definition framework, which is based on the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) ontology and uses Object Process Methodology (OPM) as its underlying modeling language. Through careful mapping of DoDAF Operational Viewpoint (OV) ontology to OPM ontology, we were able to show that the entire OV ontology can be covered by a small set of objects, processes, relations among them, and constructs comprising them. We then show how to instantiate the ontology to create a model of an actual architecture of interest (AoI) while maintaining strong typing of the model elements to ensure validity, integrity, consistency, and continuous compliance with the OV. We demonstrate our approach on the case of using drones in public safety enterprises for the purpose of crowd management in massively attended events and locations. The proposed framework allows for capturing ConOps and OpsCon in a lightweight, yet robust and consistent manner, and improve communication and concept validation between operational stakeholders and enterprise architects.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference</research-notes><custom3>2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

This paper presents a viable solution for robotic swarm communication and navigation for different autonomous applications. Communication is achieved through ZigBee radio modems and an expandable protocol to accommodate different types of data. This proposed communication system also allows dynamic swarm expansion, where a new member can be added to the swarm family. It is a complementary approach for task coordination and navigation.

Commonly, multi-UAV systems require to reach and maintain a specific flight formation during mission execution. This can be achieved by using a distributed UAV formation control strategy in which each UAV has a flight controller whose function is to calculate the control actions for the UAV actuators such that the UAV formation is maintained. To perform this task, the control strategy requires the reliable and timely exchange of information within the UAV formation. The information that is needed by the controller is commonly referred to as state information (SI). It has been assumed that SI can be properly disseminated by means of multi-hop communications, i.e., by deploying a flying ad-hoc network (FANET). In this sense, multi-hop broadcast protocols (MBPs) that were previously proposed for mobile and vehicular ad-hoc networks seem to be suited for this task. However, previous work dealing with distributed UAV formation control has made communication and networking assumptions that would be hard to fulfill in actual FANET deployments. Moreover, the efficiency of the MBPs to disseminate SI within a FANET remains unexplored. The goal of this paper is to analyze how the network performance offered by different MBPs impacts the effectiveness of distributed UAV formation control to maintain UAV formation. An evaluation framework to perform this task is proposed in this paper. The simulation results demonstrate the relevance of MBP performance in SI message dissemination and thus in the ability of the controller to maintain a formation. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Existing solutions for search missions in both terrestrial and aerial domains are mostly limited to single agent and specific environments; however, search missions can significantly benefit from the use of multiple agents that can quickly adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) that realizes the actor-critic framework in a distributed manner for coordinating multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the exploration of unknown regions. One of the original aspects of our work is that the actors represent simulated or actual UAVs exploring the environment in parallel instead of traditional computer threads. Also, we propose addition of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network layers to the actor and critic architectures to handle imperfect communication and partial observability scenarios. The proposed approach has been evaluated in a grid world and has been compared against other competing algorithms such as Multi-Agent Q-Learning, Multi-Agent Deep Q-Learning to show its advantages. More generally, our approach could be extended to image-based/continuous action space environments as well.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE 17th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE 17th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)</research-notes><custom3>2020 IEEE 17th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Common to these flight controllers is the use of the Micro Air Vehicle Communications Protocol (MAVLink) that allows the flight controller to communicate with a ground control station. However, it is still challenging to experiment with multiple such aerial vehicles concurrently. To this end, we have developed an open software/hardware platform-the University at Buffalo's Airborne Networking and Communications testbed (UB-ANC)-that facilitates rapid development and deployment of multi-drone applications. In this paper, we present the UB-ANC Emulator, an emulation environment to design, implement, and test various applications (missions) involving one or more drones in software, and provides seamless transition to experimentation. We validate the UB-ANC Emulator's output against experimental data collected in a mission with three networked drones to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy, and we demonstrate its scalability up to 100 drones using a simulated 'leader-follower' mission. © 2016 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Conference name: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots, SIMPAR 2016; Conference date: 13 December 2016 through 16 December 2016; Conference code: 126624&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots (SIMPAR)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Int.

Each thread performs one specific task, such as communication, path planning, control, mission management, health monitor and data logging.

Failure to communicate remotely sensed mission data to the base may render the system ineffective, and the inability to exchange command and control messages can lead to system failures. This paper describes a unique method to control communications through distributed task allocation to engage under-utilized UAVs to serve as communication relays and to ensure that the network supports mission tasks. The distributed algorithm uses task assignment information, including task location and proposed execution time, to predict the network topology and plan support using relays. By explicitly coupling task assignment and relay creation processes the team is able to optimize the use of agents to address the needs of dynamic complex missions. The framework is designed to consider realistic network communication dynamics including path loss, stochastic fading, and information routing. The planning strategy is shown to ensure that agents support both datarate and interconnectivity bit-error-rate requirements during task execution. System performance is characterized through experiments both in simulation and in outdoor flight testing with a team of three UAVs.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49785/A.

Compared to single UAVs, using multiple UAVs as a collaborative swarm is considerably more effective for target tracking, reconnaissance, and surveillance missions because of their capacity to tackle complex problems synergistically. Success rates in target detection and tracking depend on map coverage performance, which in turn relies on network connectivity between UAVs to propagate surveillance results to avoid revisiting already observed areas. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing three objectives for a swarm of UAVs: (a) target detection and tracking, (b) map coverage, and (c) network connectivity. Our approach, Dual-Pheromone Clustering Hybrid Approach (DPCHA), incorporates a multi-hop clustering and a dual-pheromone ant-colony model to optimize these three objectives. Clustering keeps stable overlay networks, while attractive and repulsive pheromones mark areas of detected targets and visited areas. Additionally, DPCHA introduces a disappearing target model for dealing with temporarily invisible targets. Extensive simulations show that DPCHA produces significant improvements in the assessment of coverage fairness, cluster stability, and connection volatility. We compared our approach with a pure dual- pheromone approach and a no-base model, which removes the base station from the model. Results show an approximately 50% improvement in map coverage compared to the pure dual-pheromone approach.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)</research-notes><custom3>2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCONF)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

In this paper, we investigate a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based UAV relaying network that helps data transmission from a base station (BS) to remote multiple users. To improve spectral efficiency of the investigated UAV relaying network, we provide a generalized user grouping protocol that partitions users into multiple groups and transmit data via NOMA within the same group. Then, we further formulate a joint optimization problem of the NOMA user grouping, the UAV position, and the UAV transmit power to maximize the system throughput. The formulated problem is non-convex which makes it difficult to solve directly, hence, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed NOMA-based UAV relaying scheme achieves significant throughput gains compared with other benchmark schemes.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)</research-notes><custom3>2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Such scenario demands continuous monitoring of the region and take account of its priority areas which will require control interactions, both in mission planning and execution. The methodology approach is based on priority gradients combined with region partitioning, where the points of greatest interest are updated more frequently. The proposed system is based on the coordination of embedded agents using spatial coordination on strategical positioning and role exchange. The system architecture is composed by three modules, namely, the ground control station, for mission planning and control through user interaction; a quadrotors team, capable of navigation by inertial and satellite systems; and the control agents embedded in aircrafts, responsible for communications, task allocation and payload mission control. The preliminary results are validated using both computer simulation and a real flight with quadrotors.

The resource constraints and dynamic nature of the swarm bring critical challenges to the design of UAV routing protocols. Most of the conventional ad hoc routing schemes are not intelligent and cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of UAV swarming networks. On the other hand, some artificial intelligence (AI)-based routing schemes may consume significant computational resources in the UAVs. In this article, a low-cost, adaptive routing protocol, namely skeleton-based swarm routing (SSR), is proposed, which exploits an intelligent online learning algorithm and the topology features of the mission-driven UAV swarm to distribute the traffic over optimal routes. Here, the skeleton represents the most stable parts of the swarm formation. SSR architecture consists of three modules: 1) A geometric addressing module, which assigns geometric coordinates to each node based on the swarm skeleton structure; 2) A leaf-like routing pipe which allows the selection of multiple candidate routes around the shortest path; 3) An intelligent low-complexity learning model which determines how to distribute the packets inside the routing pipe to achieve load-balanced, high-throughput transmissions. The proposed skeleton-based scheme can also facilitate the UAV formation construction and morphing. The simulation results show that the proposed SSR protocol can noticeably improve the network performance (up to 100% throughput improvement) compared to the single path routing schemes, such as the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and link-quality and traffic-load aware optimized link state routing (LTA-OLSR) protocols. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: F.

The algorithm is applied to UAV Teams. MPCR selects the node that has largest connectivity as cluster head so as to reduce the change of the cluster head and cluster members. Meanwhile, in order to provide communication services for the disconnected clusters, MPCR introduces ferry nodes which forward messages selectively in order to diffuse and submit the copy of the message better.

This paper presents an architecture for the integration of Command, Control, Computing, Communication, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (C4ISR), developed within the scope of the Brazilian Ministry of Defense, in the context of operations with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) - swarm drones - and the Internet-to-the-battlefield (IoBT) concept.

Hence, the cloud-based computation offloading is widely adopted, nevertheless, for some latency-sensitive tasks, e.g., object recognition, path planning, etc., the cloud-based manner is inappropriate due to the excessive delay. Even in some harsh environments, e.g., disaster area, battlefield, etc., there is no wireless infrastructure existed to combine the drones and cloud center. Thus, to solve the problem encountered by cloud-based computation offloading, in this paper, Fog Computing aided Swarm of Drones (FCSD) architecture is proposed. Considering the uncertainty factors in harsh environments which may threaten the success of FCSD processing tasks, not only the latency model, but also the reliability model of FCSD is constructed to guarantee the high reliability of task completion. Moreover, in view of the limited battery life of the drone, we formulated the problem as the task allocation problem which minimized the energy consumption of FCSD under the constraints of latency and reliability. Furthermore, to speed up the process of the optimization problem solving to improve the practicality, relying on the recent advances in distributed convex optimization, we develop a fast Proximal Jacobi Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based distributed algorithm. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</abstract><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49797/X.

This has given rise to new systems called UAVs Traffic Management (UTM) systems. Nevertheless, currently, there is a lack of communication infrastructures that can support the requirements of UTM systems. Luckily, the envisioned 5G mobile network has introduced the concept of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) in its architecture to support mission-critical applications by decreasing the end-to-end latency and the unreliability of communication. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the network latency and reliability on the control of UAVs' flights. The obtained results show that a UAV can deviate from its intended path with more than 5m if the network latency exceeds 400ms and with more than 2m if the packet loss probability exceeds 0.2. To overcome these limitations, we have leveraged MEC to provide a new UTM framework that enables an efficient traffic management. Moreover, due to MEC resource-limited nature and in order to give an insight about the resource provisioning, we have evaluated the scalability of the proposed solution in terms of the number of UAVs that can be handled without affecting the efficiency of the proposed UTM framework.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</research-notes><custom3>2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Meanwhile, it was worth noting that the terminal node may be disturbed by aggregated interference caused by dense network signaling interaction in the future 5G/B5G systems. Therefore, after TS and PS protocols designing and utilizing, the closed-form expressions of outage probability and bit error rate (BER) for UAV relay assisted IoT systems suffered from aggregated interference were derived in detail. In addition, the throughput and delay limited state of UAV relay assisted transmission were also analyzed thoroughly. The derivations and analysis results showed that the proposed multi-parameter joint optimization of transmitting power, scaling factor, and UAV relay selection could effectively improve the system throughput and reduce the system outage probability and BER. The simulation experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and the correctness of theoretical analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

UAVs should collect data for a defined area with a variety of sensors. When these UAVs are operating in swarm formation, the observation area could be increased and it would also be possible to deal with a loss of a UAV. The big amount of data produced by the UAVs requires high date rate connectivity, therefore the free space optical (FSO) communication is suitable. When using FSO links some important issues need be considered, the beam attenuation due the atmosphere on one side and the alignment of the FSO units on the other side. The alignment raises technical challenges in tracking and acquisition.

A rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) user and multiple ground users (GUEs) are served by ground base stations (GBSs) by utilizing the uplink NOMA protocol. The UAV is dispatched to upload specific information bits to each target GBSs. Specifically, our goal is to minimize the UAV mission completion time by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and UAV-GBS association order while taking into account the UAV's interference to non-associated GBSs. The formulated problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem and involves infinite variables. To tackle this problem, we efficiently check the feasibility of the formulated problem by utilizing graph theory and topology theory. Next, we prove that the optimal UAV trajectory needs to satisfy the fly-hover-fly structure. With this insight, we first design an efficient solution with predefined hovering locations by leveraging graph theory techniques. Furthermore, we propose an iterative UAV trajectory design by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, which is guaranteed to coverage to a locally optimal solution. We demonstrate that the two proposed designs exhibit polynomial time complexity. Finally, numerical results show that: 1) the SCA based design outperforms the fly-hover-fly based design; 2) the UAV mission completion time is significantly minimized with proposed NOMA schemes compared with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; 3) the increase of GUEs' quality of service (QoS) requirements will increase the UAV mission completion time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Leader-followers formation is a widely used swarm management scenario where a leader drone frequently broadcasts controlling messages to all follower drones to achieve collaboratively a common mission. However, managing such a UAV swarm, especially when the member drones dynamically join and leave the swarm, introduces significant security challenges and performance overhead.In this work, we propose a Swarm Broadcast Protocol (SBP) to facilitate the security protection of leader-followers formation based UAV swarms. SBP contains a security key management scheme that manages a broadcast key among the swarm for leader to broadcast encrypted messages to followers. When swarm membership changes, the broadcast key will be updated and synchronized among the swarm to maintain both backward and forward secrecy. The overhead of SBP is small that only constant computational overhead is needed for both swarm leader and followers to achieve key synchronization when a new drone joins regardless of the current swarm size. This feature would highly reduce the overhead when there are many individual drone joining events. Through experiments on network emulator, we show that SBP achieves lowest bandwidth overhead and CPU utilization to handle multiple swarm membership changing events, comparing with two public-key-based swarm management protocol baselines.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)</research-notes><custom3>2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.  © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 55; Correspondence Address: L.T.

Firstly, the second-order system dynamic model of the UAV is established. Secondly, the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function containing the distance term are defined, and the potential field function between the UAVs considering the influence of communication is designed to realize the control objectives of UAV collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and smoothly reaching the target point. Then, a new consensus control protocol is designed by combining IAPF and consensus theory. UAVs can achieve convergence and consensus of relative distance and speed between the UAVs while maintaining the stability of the formation. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the stability of the system, and simulations are carried out through the formation of four UAVs. The results show that this method can achieve the control objectives of collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and the convergence of position and speed in the formation of trajectory planning. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 40th Chinese Control Conference, CCC 2021; Conference date: 26 July 2021 through 28 July 2021; Conference code: 172297&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 40th Chinese Control Conference, CCC 2021, July 26, 2021 - July 28, 2021&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Chinese Control Conf., CCC&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 40th Chinese Control Conference, CCC 2021, July 26, 2021 - July 28, 2021</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117319005&amp;doi=10.23919%2fCCC52363.2021.9550138&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4eab5245d239597bd0edd57a01d0aa3e</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550138</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Shanghai, China</custom1><custom3>40th Chinese Control Conference, CCC 2021, July 26, 2021 - July 28, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>I.

Applications such as signal tracking or dynamic object tracking with multiple UAVs allow a cost-effective and minimum-risk alternative to missions which have been historically handled with manned aircraft. As such, for these specific applications, we have developed a micro-avionics architecture structured around an in-house customized open-source autopilot and an indigenous Linux based single board payload/flight management computer. The essential 5-km range telemetry and control link radio is backed up by high-power long-range IEEE 802.11n (WiFi) radio device. The redundancy of communication not only improves the reliability of the avionics architecture, but also enables the trade-off between bandwidth and power efficiency. The architecture is capable of transmitting data at rates above 200 kbps up to 4 km away from its ground station equipped with the developed miniature patch antenna tracker. The payload/flight management computer is ready to run a CSI/USB connected day-light or low-illumination infra-red camera, a USB connected software defined radio and different types of sensor payloads such as radar/lidar range sensors and RGBD cameras. Tied to this architecture, we have designed a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing system with MAVlink communication protocol interlinking hardware to Matlab based UAV dynamic models and tracking algorithms. This system allows comprehensive simulation and testing of designed control and guidance algorithms before flight tests while minimizing cost and crash risk. We have successfully used the avionics architecture in flight tests that involve (a) system identification of flight vehicles and (b) tracking and identification of signal sources using multiple UAVs.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 12th International Conference on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, ICMAE 2021; Conference date: 16 July 2021 through 19 July 2021; Conference code: 171531&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 12th International Conference on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, ICMAE 2021, July 16, 2021 - July 19, 2021&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 12th International Conference on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (ICMAE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING (ICMAE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

The interaction protocol of a message varies according to the message's type and meaning. The interaction framework will help human operator make it easier to control different kinds of multi-domain unmanned systems and make autonomous cooperative between unmanned systems possible.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology (ICEICT)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology (ICEICT)</research-notes><custom3>2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology (ICEICT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

In the cloud computing architecture, the data generated by ground users (GUs) can be offloaded to the remote server for fast processing. However, the heterogeneity of mobile tasks makes the data size distributed among GUs unbalanced. Besides, the energy efficiency of UAVs movement should be carefully considered for sustainable flight and obstacle avoidance. In general, such a joint trajectory issue can hardly be formulated as a convex optimization in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper proposes a potential game combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize multiple UAVs' trajectory with the consideration of GUs' offloading delay, energy efficiency as well as obstacle avoidance system. In specific, we first model the issue as a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINP), in which the service assignment between multi-user and multi-UAV is solved by potential game. The convergence to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) can be achieved by distributive service assignment update with infinite iteration. Then, we optimize the trajectory with obstacle avoidance at each UAV by MADDPG approach, which has a great advantage of centralized-training and decentralized-execution to reduce the global synchronized communication overhead. UAVs movement can be optimized in continuity rather than other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches generating discrete simple actions. Experiments demonstrate the proposed game-combined learning algorithm can minimize the offloading delay, enhance UAVs’ energy efficiency and avoid the obstacles at the same time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Edge computing resources deployed near crop fields support autonomous agents with substantial computational needs for tasks such as AI inference. In large fields, using multiple autonomous agents, called swarms, can speed up crop management tasks if sufficient edge resources are provisioned. However, to use swarms today, farmers and software developers craft their own standalone solutions that are either simple and ineffective or complicated and hard-to-reproduce. We present MARbLE, a platform for developing and managing swarms. MARbLE provides an easy-to-use programming paradigm that helps users build swarm workloads using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Developers supply just two functions Map() and Eval(). The platform automatically compiles and deploys swarms and continuously updates the reinforcement learning models that govern their actions. Developers can experiment with multiple swarm and edge resource configurations both in simulation and with actual in-field runs. We studied real UAV swarms conducting digital agriculture missions. We observe that swarms demanded edge computing resources in bursts; the ratio of average to peak demand was 2.9X. MARbLE uses energy-saving load balancing policies to duty cycle machines during workload demand troughs, leveraging workload patterns to save edge energy. Using MARbLE, we found that four-agent swarms with load balancing techniques sped up missions by 2.1X and reduced edge energy usage by up to 2X compared to state of the art autonomous swarms.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE/ACM 7th Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE/ACM 7th Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49789/J.

We bring to bear the notion of group feedback (gNACK/gACK) for broadcast/multicast transmissions, where an ACK/NACK is determined not on a peruser, or per-packet basis, but instead, based on multiple users, and multiple packets. We formulate this problem as a submodular optimization problem to obtain optimal solutions, and algorithms in minimizing the sum-rate for determining the gNACK (gACK) under the assumption that each user in the swarm is aware of the error rates of all other users. We then extend the structure of the optimal algorithm to devise distributed group feedback protocols, where a user operates solely on its own error rates, and does not possess information on error rates of other users. We show that the proposed distributed group feedback protocol is ≈ 1.5% away from the optimal solution. PHY/MAC system design aspects of the group feedback protocols regarding cellular systems are outlined. Simulation results assessing the performance of the proposed protocols are provided. With the goal of embracing the evolving perspective of UAVs to swarming use cases, where a network of UAVs cooperate to accomplish a mission are envisioned, this study becomes important as it enables spectrally efficient feedback, and local packet loss recovery schemes, without invoking the base station.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)</research-notes><custom3>2018 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The CAT is a real-time testbed built on the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) architecture that integrates five and six degree-of-freedom dynamic models of up to 64 Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS) wide area search weapons, with mission planning tools, models of the release aircraft, a simulation of wireless communication between weapons via 802.11b type protocols, and a synchronous unmanned aircraft in-the-loop. The goals of cooperative attack include enhancing weapon performance and increasing battlefield situational awareness. By sharing information on their own states and the state of their observations, weapons or UAVs may re-plan trajectories in-flight, determine what targets to attack, and increase the probability of target detection and classification. The weapon or UAV entities may also exchange sensor information with off-board sensors and control authorities.

Each robot may have homogeneous or heterogeneous capabilities and can be programmed with several fundamental control laws adapting to the environment. Through different kinds of relationships built using the communication protocols, they present various behaviors based on the shared information and current state. To adapt to dynamic environments effectively, and maximize the utility of the group, robots need to cooperate, share their local information, and make a suitable plan according to the specific scenario. In this paper, we formalize the problem of multi-robots fulfilling dynamic tasks using state transitions represented through a Behavior Tree. We design a framework with corresponding distributed algorithms for communications between robots and negotiation and agreement protocols through a novel priority mechanism. Finally, we evaluate our framework through simulation experiments. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Conference name: 2nd International Symposium on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems, MRS 2019; Conference date: 22 August 2019 through 23 August 2019; Conference code: 154450&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Symposium on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems (MRS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

Design of such systems requires knowledge of the flight dynamics of UAVs and the communication links connecting UAVs with each other or with the ground control station. Besides, UAV networks are dynamic and distinctive from other ad-hoc networks and require protocols that can adapt to high-mobility, dynamic topology and changing link quality in power constrained resource platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to co-design the UAV path planning algorithms and the communication protocols. The proposed co-simulation framework integrates existing tools to simulate flight dynamics and network related aspects. Gazebo with robot operating system (ROS) is used as a physical system UAV simulator and NS-3 is used as a network simulator, to jointly capture the cyber-physical system (CPS) aspects of the multi-UAV systems. A particular aspect we address is on synchronizing time and position across the two simulation environments, and we provide APIs to allow easy migration of the algorithms to real platforms. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Conference name: 2020 International Conference on COMmunication Systems and NETworkS, COMSNETS 2020; Conference date: 7 January 2020 through 11 January 2020; Conference code: 158297&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 International Conference on COMmunication Systems &amp; NETworkS (COMSNETS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

Compared to the traditional ad-hoc networks, FANETs are more efficient in completing their task in catastrophic situations to deliver data communication services from the height. However, type of the mission and sensitivity of the application requires an adaptive, efficient, and scalable communication network for data transmission among the UAVs. Such network are challenged by the high mobility and frequent topology changes, resulting connectivity loss problem. In this context, the UAVs in FANETs have been deployed with omnidirectional antennas, which leads to restrict the overall performance of the network. Alternately, directional antennas have the potential to enhance the transmission range, spatial reuse, and capacity of the network effectively. Nevertheless, these benefits also bring some unique challenges, particularly for the MAC layer. In order to overcome such constraints, we propose a new directional antennas based medium access control (MAC) protocol to adapt the FANETs architecture. The idea is to use multiple directional antennas on a single UAV with IEEE 802.11 protocol. The design goal is to improve the overall performance of the network and to provide solutions to some of the unique challenges of using directional antennas. The integrated solution is modeled in OPNET and evaluated for throughput, end-to-end delay, and retransmission attempts. The simulation results authenticate that the proposed IEEE 802.11-based directional antennas protocol could significantly increase the performance of FANETs as compared to omnidirectional antennas.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 5th International Multi-Topic ICT Conference (IMTIC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 5th International Multi-Topic ICT Conference (IMTIC)</research-notes><custom3>2018 5th International Multi-Topic ICT Conference (IMTIC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

One critical aspect to enable the use of such vehicles is the coordination/planning system, whose task complexity increases with the number of vehicles and the communications constraints that arise due to their small size and large distances. In this work, we propose a control architecture for a platoon of relay UAVs that are independent of the coordination system. The platoon task consists in interconnecting the communication link between the possibly mobile command station and a UAV in a mission. The relays are actively driven to deploy, create a network and maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. We present an architecture that is composed by a waypoint generator based on the network QoS and a Time Coordinated Path Following (TCPF) controller with a method to reduce the frequency of information exchange between the relay UAVs, through the use of a self-triggered control strategy. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a mission operation for a UAV without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the relay-UAVs platoon. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the developed strategy. The self-triggered approach results in significant reduction of information exchange between the relay UAVs, while maintaining the user desired network QoS.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 Workshop on Research, Education and Development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (RED-UAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 Workshop on Research, Education and Development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (RED-UAS)</research-notes><custom3>2017 Workshop on Research, Education and Development of Unmanned Aerial Systems (RED-UAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

We first build a 3D model of a random irregular terrain and project the 3D terrain surface into many weighted 2D patches. Then we develop a two-level hierarchical UAV swarm architecture, including the low-level follower UAVs (FUAVs) and the high-level leader UAVs (LUAVs). For FUAVs, we adopt the traditional coverage trajectory algorithm to carry out specific coverage tasks within patches based on the star communication topology. For LUAVs, we propose a swarm deep Q-learning (SDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm to select patches. The numerical results show that the total coverage time of the SDQN is less than that of existing methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: ICC 2021 - IEEE International Conference on Communications&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: ICC 2021 - IEEE International Conference on Communications</research-notes><custom3>ICC 2021 - IEEE International Conference on Communications</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

However, most existing routing protocols for UAV networks aim at unicast routing, and there are few multicast protocols dedicated to UAV networks. Furthermore, most existing multicast protocols for mobile wireless networks usually maintain a forwarding structure, and they are inefficient in UAV networks due to the unique characteristics of UAVs, such as high-speed movement and sparse distribution. For many UAV applications, the trajectories of UAVs are pre-planned in advance through mission planning and trajectory planning, and the location and motion information of UAVs can be obtained through positioning technology and inertial sensors. In this paper, we propose an efficient Trajectory-Based Multicast (TBM) routing protocol for UAV networks. TBM utilizes the trajectory information to compute the encounters between UAVs, then a priority metric that characterizes the ability of a UAV to forward a message to multiple destination nodes is calculated. Based on the priority metric, TBM constructs a priority encounter graph, which considers the timeliness and stability of message forwarding, thus finding a multicast forwarding sequence with low delay and high delivery ratio. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TBM. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 7; Conference name: 22nd IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, 18th IEEE International Conference on Smart City and 6th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Systems, HPCC-SmartCity-DSS 2020; Conference date: 14 December 2020 through 16 December 2020; Conference code: 168653&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE 22nd International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 18th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 6th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Further, multi-purpose drones can be widely deployed for not only gathering information but also analyzing the situation from sensed data. However, mobile drone systems have limited computing resources and battery power which makes it a challenge to use these systems for long periods of time or in fully autonomous modes. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Computation Offloading Drone System (ACODS) architecture with reliable communication for increasing drone operating time. We design not only the response time prediction module for mission critical task offloading decision but also task offloading management module via the Multipath TCP (MPTCP). Through performance evaluation via our prototype implementation, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant increase in drone operation time and significantly reduces the response time.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 16th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 16th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)</research-notes><custom3>2017 16th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clustering is a significant technology in FANETs. In each cluster, the cluster head (CH) is responsible for cluster management. However, due to the frequent movement and limited energy of UAVs, one of the foremost challenges in FANETs is unstable communication performance of cluster. Hence, to cope with this issue, we propose a Mobility Aware Clustering scheme based on Swarm Intelligence (MACSI) for FANETs, which is enlightened by animal collective behavior. More specifically, the modified glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm based on chaos strategy is put forward for CH selection and cluster formation. It aims to help UAVs cooperate with each other to conduct missions and change their positions accordingly. In addition, a stable CH selection mechanism depends on energy, position and the movement relationship. Our proposal has been evaluated with respect to metrics as energy consumption and cluster life time. The experimental results obtained validate that, the proposed scheme has less energy consumption and extended cluster life time compared with existing clustering schemes.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)</research-notes><custom3>2020 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

This paper presents a novel Hungarian-based approach to challenging multi-task allocation (MTA) problems, where the number of UAVs is smaller than the number of tasks. We developed the Cluster-Based Hungarian Algorithm (CBHA), in which (1) tasks are grouped such that the number of UAVs is the same as the number of task groups, (2) the original Hungarian algorithm is applied, and (3) an algorithm for travel-salesman-problem (TSP) is applied to perform path planning for individual UAVs. The performance of the proposed CBHA was compared with the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA) in Monti Carlo simulations, where different numbers of UAVs and tasks were adopted in the scenario of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles traveling through a number of targeting locations. The simulation result shows that the CBHA outperforms CBBA in all cases.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)</research-notes><custom3>2019 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

In this paper, we identify scaling issues and present some simple results in the domain of individual mobile robots, as well as teams, swarms, etc., deployed on sensing missions. Since most robot-based sensing missions anticipate mini-, micro-, and nano-scale robots, our explicit examples focus on scaling-down of existing human-scale robot design and concepts. However the principles articulated apply equally to scaling-up situations. The topic is introduced via a simple example that shows why scaling-down of mobile robots that carry their own energy source will generally prove impractical: to obtain reasonable operating times it will rather be necessary to develop small robots into which energy can be beamed, or which can forage for energy sources in the environment. From this concrete illustrative example, the paper moves on to a higher level discussion of robot architecture and the applicability of scaling principles, to varying degrees, to all the modules, i.e., it is not exclusively a mobility issue. There follows a short discussion of how changes of scale are not inherently problematic, but to the contrary, in many cases suitable scale change provides the key to solving a difficult engineering problem. The final section is a quantitative example in which design and operating parameters of the robotic nodes of a sensor network are considered from the perspective of operating time limited by the energy cost of node-to-node communication. This example powerfully illustrates a system in which fairly modest changes contemplated range of engineering parameters result in enormous changes in the anticipated operating time of the system.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 20th IEEE Instrumentation Technology Conference (Cat.

In this context, more than one robot must have the ability to simultaneously perform different tasks in a certain coordination and plan. In the solution of the related problem, it has been tried to ensure that the robots communicate and move in coordination over a central communication architecture. The most important handicap of central architectures is that the communication mechanism of the whole system collapses in case the related unit fails because the system is connected to a single unit. In this context, a novel decentralized architecture has been implemented and tested for physical robots.

Within a swarm, UAVs communicate by means of a Flying Multi-hop Network (FMN), which due to its dynamics induces frequent changes of network topology and quality of the links. Recently, UAVs have also been used to provide Internet access and enhance the capacity of existing networks in Temporary Events. This brings up additional routing challenges not yet addressed, in order to provide always-on and high capacity paths able to meet the Quality of Service expected by the users.This paper presents RedeFINE, a centralized routing solution for FMNs that selects high-capacity paths between UAVs and avoids communications disruptions, by defining in advance the forwarding tables and the instants they shall be updated in the UAVs; this represents a major step forward with respect to traditional routing protocols. The performance evaluation of RedeFINE shows promising results, especially regarding Throughput and Packet Delivery Ratio, when compared with state of the art routing solutions. © 2018 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Conference name: 14th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications, WiMob 2018; Conference date: 15 October 2018 through 17 October 2018; Conference code: 143866&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 14th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

An autonomous fleet of cooperating UAVs can render more efficient and robust ability to complete the missions. In order to make multiple UAVs fly cooperatively in an autonomous way without control from the ground station, one of the key techniques is communication network technology. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to construct a clustered-backbone to support both broadcast and unicast communications for UAV networks. In our algorithm, UAVs clustering and virtual backbone construction only need the information exchange among adjacent UAVs. We also propose a strategy to dynamically maintain this clustered-backbone network. We test our scheme using four commercial UAVs enhanced by an ARM-based embedded computer to demonstrate the distributed control and dynamic maintenance features of the algorithm.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;More algorithm, less architecture&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 14th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 14th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)</research-notes><custom3>2018 14th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Effectively networking services across distributed systems (e.g., drone formations) allows nodes to contribute their collective resources toward achieving mission objectives. Automating unit coordination and node management, within a reusable middleware framework, aligns with goals envisioned in NASA's Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) and the National Research Council's Space Studies Board recommendations for CubeSat swarms and constellations for advanced aerospace missions. To provide reliable system management, software services should possess automaticity and fault-tolerance. Additionally, networking services for aerospace platforms should be robust, portable, and reusable for many mission life cycles. Researchers at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center for Space, High-performance, and Resilient Computing (SHREC) have developed a system architecture that can be deployed as a reusable middleware for distributed systems in hazardous aerospace environments. © 2018 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 37th IEEE/AIAA International Digital Avionics Systems Conference, DASC 2018; Conference date: 23 September 2018 through 27 September 2018; Conference code: 143574; CODEN: ADACF&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060613131&amp;doi=10.1109%2fDASC.2018.8569889&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=405d23200d8e3f481ace443f389f3d1b</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

The Airborne Embedded auTonomOUs Robust Network of Objects and Sensors (AETOURNOS) project is designed as a federative, fueling platform and global evaluation tool. It has spawned another collaborative project bridging the gap between Computer Science and Automation: 6PO (Cyber-Physical Systems and Cooperative Control of a Fleet of UAVs). We want to investigate new flocking strategies, mobility-aware communication protocols (and reciprocally: movements influenced by network QoS), and to ease the cooperation between experts, we need co-simulation solutions, and “universal” control interfaces. This article presents our first contribution to this grand scheme: a stand-alone simulation of an autonomous flocking strategy taking into account both the dynamics of the UAVs and their communications, which has allowed us to examine the relation between network unreliability and control computation. To better study the influence of the communication network, we present an architecture coupling a dedicated network simulator with the UAVs simulator, as well as with a real drone piloting interface. The lessons learned help us build a research and action plan for the years to come.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</research-notes><custom3>2014 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

While SDN is mainly applied in wired networks, we attempt to utilize it in a futuristic drone-based network architecture to capitalize on the programmability and flexibility offered by SDN. Such drone network comprises a multi-hop network of drones as the nodes of the network which also act as programmable network nodes and forwarding elements. In such a dynamic and mobile network, maintaining SDN controller connectivity becomes a challenge, especially when the drone network requires operating independently from a ground infrastructure for some deployment scenarios. In this work, we attempt to address this challenge by implementing a dynamic scheme for controller placement that deploys a minimum number of drones that operate as SDN controllers and adjust their locations dynamically as the controlled nodes adjust their locations to meet changing mission requirements.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</research-notes><custom3>2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

Real-time updates including positions of neighboring nodes is performed when, for example, autonomous vehicles execute a cooperative maneuver, industrial robots collaborate with each other on a task, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) execute a mission in a swarm. For the design of networked automatic control strategies in these scenarios, it is essential to understand the performance of such Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications from the information freshness perspective. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework which allows characterizing the Age of Information (AoI) in networks governed by the Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol. Differently from existing work, we take into account the fact that update packets sent by mobile nodes are not necessarily periodic, since packet triggering is often coupled with agents' mobility. Our approach is based on the assumption that diverse mobility-triggered message generation patterns can be modeled by a wide class of update traffic arrival processes. We apply Discrete Markovian Arrival Process (DMAP), which is a versatile arrival model able to fit arrival patterns that are modulated by a finite state machine, including bursty traffic. We develop an accurate and efficient analytical model of nodes exchanging one-hop broadcast update messages with bursty arrivals to evaluate the moments as well as entire probability distribution of several performance metrics, including AoI. An asymptotic analysis for large networks suggests a simple way to control the update message rate to minimize the AoI. We show that the optimal update rate that minimizes the mean AoI coincides with the optimum of the wireless channel utilization. Numerical examples point out that the asymptotic theory provides accurate predictions also for small values of the number of nodes.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: A.

To this end, a planning and control system architecture is discussed first, which includes various modules such as sensory data collection, crowd detection, tracking, motion planning, control command generation, and control strategy evaluation. The modules that are highly related with agent-based modeling (focus of this paper) are then discussed, which includes the UAV/UGV motion planning considering multi-objectives, crowd motion modeling via social force model, and enhancement of simulation environment via GIS 3D coordinates conversion. In the experiment, Repast Simphony is used as the agent-based modeling tool, which transmits sensory data and control commands with QGroundControl as hardware interface that further conducts radio communications with ArduCopter as a real UAV. Preliminary results show that finer grid scale and larger vehicle detection range generate a better crowd coverage percentage.

The overarching research goal that drives this study is to design a system that pushes decision-making to the UAV swarm on the battlefield such that mission tasks are completed more reliably and in less time than traditional centralized UAV-based missions. We use theoretical and measurement-based analysis to validate the system. Through experiments conducted using a simplified variant of a Coordinated Search and Tracking (CSAT) application in IH-UAS, we demonstrate that IH-UAS performs better than the same application operating in a traditional centralized solution.

In this paper we combine foraging and building task as a new type task and implement on our swarm robotic system-SociBuilder. The platform is composed of three parts: active region, modules and many robots called Socibots. In order to execute the task automatically and effectively, we propose a new system architecture including three layers: human-computer interaction layer (HCI), planning layer and execution layer. For the same reason, we put forward a novel algorithm to adjust individual behavior dynamically. As a result of our experiments, Socibots use only local information and do not need communication with others in forage, and fewer individuals are centralized control for building task.

With 5G New Radio (5G NR), UAS swarm networking can yield high capacities of mobile communication to provide more stable, effective services for UAS swarm. However, the conventional architectures of UAS swarm networking are centralized and hierarchical, thus restricting the high volume communication due to heterogeneous swarm communication, and the deployment of UAS swarms on a large scale. In this paper, inspired by the behavior of cell communication, we propose a cell wall oriented bi-Throughput optimization algorithm for UAS swarm networking. To be specific, We leverage edge-coloring to optimize the routing schedule to obtain the maximum throughput for each UAS swarm. The evaluation shows that the throughput from both directions can be enhanced to achieve an improvement of up to 90% when the time slot is less than 0. 01s. The 5G-enabled optimal bi-Throughput solution shows great potential to provide UAS swarm networking more compatible capacities for the challenging mission in real-Time. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Conference name: 1st International Conference on Space-Air-Ground Computing, SAGC 2020; Conference date: 4 December 2020 through 6 December 2020; Conference code: 168562&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 International Conference on Space-Air-Ground Computing (SAGC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc. - Int.

The overall cost (including price, weight, energy, etc.) of the payload required by some missions is sometimes too important to enable the robots of the swarm to embed all the required capabilities (i.e., sensors and actuators). This is the reason why it is more suitable to spread all the capabilities among the robots of the swarm. In this case, it is necessary to implement a collaborative system inside the swarm in order to share the capabilities among them. This collaborative system should provide task allocation as well as management of conflicts and failures which can occur at any moment. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative system for heterogeneous swarms of autonomous mobile robots called AMiRALE (Asynchronous Missions Relay for Autonomous and Lively Entities). Our system if fully distributed and relies only on asynchronous communications. We provide a formal description of our proposal based on a graph relabeling system. We also present experimental results obtained through both simulation and emulation. Our evaluation is based on a park cleaning scenario which relies on autonomous and specialized ground robots.  2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 International Conference on Protocol Engineering (ICPE) and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems (NTDS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: International Conference on Protocol Engineering, ICPE 2015 and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems, NTDS 2015, July 22, 2015 - July 24, 2015&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: International Conference on Protocol Engineering, ICPE 2015 and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems, NTDS 2015, July 22, 2015 - July 24, 2015</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NOTERE.2015.7293473</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Paris, France</custom1><custom3>International Conference on Protocol Engineering, ICPE 2015 and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems, NTDS 2015, July 22, 2015 - July 24, 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

In a search and rescue mission (SAR) scenario, the network solution based on Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) can meet the special requirements of this mission. However, due to the high cost of establishing a real experimental environment, network simulation is considered to be the most practical research method in most cases. For FANETs, modeling and simulation based on the mobility of a UAV in a specific scene have an important impact on the performance of routing protocols. Therefore, to develop an excellent FANETs routing protocol for SAR task scenarios, it is necessary to design a three-dimensional (3D) mobility model suitable for this scenario. This paper first analyzes the design requirements of FANETs 3D mobility model under the SAR task scene. According to these requirements, we proposed a 3DSRCM mobility model based on semi-random Circular Movement (SRCM). Based on the helix and pheromone, we design the track with its selection and switching mechanism for the model. Subsequently, we tested the relevant performance of the model according to the design requirements, and the test results proved that the model could truly simulate the movement behavior of UAV in the SAR scene, with excellent coverage and smooth three-dimensional trajectory, as well as relatively good spatial node distribution and network connectivity.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 7th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 7th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)</research-notes><custom3>2021 7th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The configuration of these tasks related to single or multi-robot algorithms depends on the individual requirements of the scenario (i.e. number of entities, communication bandwidth, failure assumptions). Therefore, the developer may decide to run a path planning algorithm individually for each robot to avoid an additional exchange of information. For a scenario with a large communication bandwidth, a planner in the global context would be more suitable in order to receive an optimal result. In this paper we present an architecture that implements this decision online. Our context-aware task controller evaluates the communication situation and triggers a context switch (global, local, individual) of the task execution. By shifting the decision from design-time to run-time, we close the gap between supervision and swarm approaches and provide an optimized behavior of a multi-robot application within the current configuration.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 21st IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2016; Conference date: 6 September 2016 through 9 September 2016; Conference code: 124646; CODEN: 85ROA&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 21st IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2016, September 6, 2016 - September 9, 2016&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND FACTORY AUTOMATION (ETFA)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Int.

In such scenarios, data dissemination of events towards mobile sinks should be performed reliably. In this paper we present Honeycomb Architecture which enables data dissemination considering dynamic conditions of multiple sinks and sources. Honeycomb Architecture exploits a virtual infrastructure called ‘highways’, which is an area where all event data are cached. The ‘highways’ act as rendezvous regions of the events and queries. Once a query is issued, it is sent to one of the ‘highways’ and searches relevant data stored in the ‘highway’. When the data is found, it is sent to the sink which has issued the query. Our data dissemination protocol is fault-tolerant, i.e., it can bypass holes in the network. We evaluate and compare the data delivery ratio and latency of our data dissemination protocol with previous approaches. We also analyze the hotspot regions in the network with different protocols. Simulation results show that our work significantly reduces overall energy consumption while maintaining comparably high data delivery ratio.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing</research-notes><custom3>2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>I.

Power-constrained wireless sensor networks are usable as long as they can communicate sensed data to the base station. Multi-hop data gathering consumes increased energy, especially for data-intensive applications. In this paper we propose a UAV-enabled data gathering mechanism for wireless sensor networks which prolongs network lifetime compared to a traditional data gathering mechanism. Some of the aspects that we address are UAV path planning, scheduled and opportunistic data gathering, and integration of the data gathering with a node scheduling mechanism.

Although a great deal of emphasis has been placed on the drone-assisted networks, existing work focuses on routing protocols without fully exploiting the drones superiority and flexibility. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a collaborative communication scheme for multiple drones to assist the urban vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). In this scheme, drones are distributed regarding the predicted terrestrial traffic condition in order to efficiently alleviate the inevitable problems of conventional VANETs, such as building obstacle, isolated vehicles, and uneven traffic loading. To effectively coordinate multiple drones, this issue is modeled as a multimodal optimization problem to improve the global performance on a certain space. To this end, a succinct swarm-based optimization algorithm, namely Multimodal Nomad Algorithm (MNA) is presented. This algorithm is inspired by the migratory behavior of the nomadic tribes on Mongolia grassland. Based on the floating car data of Chengdu China, extensive experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the MNA-optimized drone-assisted VANET. The results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of hop number, packet delivery ratio, and throughput.</abstract><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49793/N.

Firstly, the UAV formation model of fixed undirected communication topology was established. For the issues that may occur such as deadlocks and formation safety, the segmented idea, rotation force and potential force between the machines were introduced to improve the force function of the potential field, which made the formation realize obstacle avoidance and trajectory pre-planning accurately. Secondly, the state error of UAV was corrected according to the consistency theory, and the formation cooperative obstacle avoidance control law was designed to achieve the desired state consistency and track planning. Finally, the convergence consistency of the proposed control algorithm was proved by constructing Hamilton function.

Of particular interest are strategies for spatial coverage optimization of mobile networks and the acquisition of high quality image material targeting a photogrammetric 3D reconstruction of the area of interest. In MUAV based swarms continuous and excellent communication links are a key factor for the success of the overall achievement of objectives. However, disregarding communication aspects in mission strategies is a common simplification. In this paper we examine an agent-based approach that targets (a) high spatial sensor coverage and (b) high quality communication links. For these key figures, the performance of the suggested algorithm is evaluated. We particularly focus on channel aware mobility and on self organizing mesh topologies of MUAV based sensor swarms.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: SENSORS, 2010 IEEE&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: SENSORS, 2010 IEEE</research-notes><custom3>SENSORS, 2010 IEEE</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used as a viable remote sensing solution for planetary exploration, as desiccation cracks are difficult to identify with the naked eye and are normally located in complex and unreachable environments. However, most UAVs have a strong reliance on human operators through their communication systems, as UAVs have limited onboard decision-making capabilities for autonomous navigation in such environments. UAV navigation in real-world scenarios is also challenging as data captured from their sensors is imperfect, and outputs from computer vision systems are, sometimes, inaccurate. These sensory and onboard vision limitations cause partial observability of the state of surveyed environments, inducing uncertainty in optimal path planning. This paper proposes a UAV system for autonomous onboard navigation, identification, and mapping of desiccation cracks for planetary exploration. The navigation problem is mathematically formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where a motion strategy can be obtained by solving the POMDP in real time using the augmented belief tree (ABT) solver. The framework discussed in this work is validated with real flight tests using two desiccation crack patterns distributed across the surveyed area. Real-time segmentation from streamed camera frames of desiccation cracks is achieved through inference onboard the aircraft using a ResNet18 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and an OpenCV AI Kit (OAK)-D camera. Results from real flight tests indicate that the system can reduce levels of object detection uncertainty to locate and map desiccation cracks in environments under partial observability. The system design allows further adaptation for similar time-critical applications requiring increased levels of UAV autonomy in unstructured environments under uncertainty and partial observability, such as humanitarian relief, wildlife monitoring, and surveillance.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49790/J.

This algorithm is presented both in its basic form as well as in a secured form in order to secure and maintain trust boundaries and communication within specific groups of heterogeneous devices. The specific target application scenarios includes resource constrained environments where a co-located swarm of devices (adversarial in mission or objective) is also present. CHIRP, and its secured version (S-CHIRP), enables complete peer-to-peer communication of a n-agent network of devices in as few as n rounds. In addition to the n-round cycle length, the proposed communication mechanism has the following major properties: nodes communication is entirely decentralized, communication is resilient to the loss of nodes, and finally communication is resilient to the (re)-entry of nodes. Theoretical models show that even the secure implementation of this mechanism is capable of scaling to IoT swarms in the million device range with memory constraints in the &lt;; 10 MB range.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49792/M.

Research on multi-robot system is receiving a great deal of attention in recent years. Multi-robot system has many advantages over a single robot in certain missions, such as reducing complexity, availability of redundancy, and reconfiguration capabilities. Using coordination scheme in multiple mobile robots allows them to complete tasks with higher complexity. The ability of each robot does not have to be very complete, since each robot can focus on a particular task. Therefore, in some cases, multiple robots working together to complete a certain mission can be relatively cheaper and easier to implement than a single robot. One of the main concerns in the discussion of multi-robot system is formation control. Having a group of robots moving in formation allows user to control the entire group of robots without the need to specify the commands for each robot. This is very useful in many realworld applications, such as search and rescue missions, surveillance, security patrols, military missions, and transportation. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the formation control problem : behavior-based approach to formation control, leader-follower approach, and virtual structure approach. However, in most of these approaches, there exists one group leader (either actual robot or virtual leader) that acts as the central coordination of movement for the whole group. This introduces a single point massive failure problem to the system, i.e. when the leader is disturbed, the whole group will be severely affected. Therefore, we need a distributed approach to overcome this problem. One of the most popular algorithms in distributed control community is consensus algorithm. The algorithm is originally inspired by swarming behavior found in living systems, such as flocking behavior of group of birds. Swarm behavior specifies that in a multi agent system in which each agent acts locally by following simple rules, intelligent collective behavior could emerge, unknown to each agent. Based on this idea, consensus algorithm directs each agent's state towards agreement on a certain value. In general, there are two strategies for formation control using consensus; distance-based control, and displacement-based control. In distance-based control, each robot must keep certain distance with its neighbors. This method requires rigid graph topology for the networked robots. In displacement-based control, each robot tracks its desired position, i.e. the desired deviation from a pre-defined formation center. This method requires all agents to know the formation center. In most cases, multi-robot systems should also be able to work in a dynamically changing environment. Therefore, we also consider obstacle and/or collision avoidance as additional objective while keeping the robots in formation. Two major approaches are employed to this issue : 1) the obstacle avoidance control and distance-based formation control is added (blended) to get the overall control signal, producing smooth movement of the robots; 2) Hybrid model, in which each robot is guaranteed to be in a certain state at one time, either forming formation or avoiding obstacle. In this talk, consensus formation control with obstacle avoidance is addressed using regulated hybrid model as well as blended model. Some theoretical framework concerning consensus, formation and related graph theory for a networked of agents are briefly discussed. We then describe layered architecture of the distributed formation control system that is useful for implementation in a networked of robots. In the blended model approach, a novel scheme is presented, which combines Social Force Model (SFM) for crowd modeling and consensus algorithm. Some simulation studies are presented to show the effectiveness of these approaches. Experimental studies of formation control of swarm of robots are described. The first experiment employs a group of mobile robots connected by wireless communication. The second experiment employs a group of humanoid robots using visual localization. Finally, future research issues are briefly discussed.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 2nd International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering (ICITACEE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 2nd International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering (ICITACEE)</research-notes><custom3>2015 2nd International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering (ICITACEE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Once removed from the energy management loop, the human operator is free to concentrate on higher level task management and data analysis. This paper firstly describes the design, test and construction of an autonomous Ground Recharge Stations (GRS) for battery-powered quadrotor helicopter. In order to incorporate the charging of the quadrotors in the overall swarm behaviour, the focus of the research presented here has been to reduce the charging phase of a single vehicle by developing safer electrical contacts and using a balancer in the charging process. The amount of extra current available from the new design easily pushed the flying-time/charging- time ratio of the quadrotors over 1. Then the paper describes a novel approach for the integration of this technology into an energy efficient multi-agent system. The development of a prioritisation function and queuing protocols between the UAVs and GRSs guarantee an optimised solution to the assignment problem dependent on the mission profile. Results show that the system's energy management remains efficient regardless of number and position of the platforms, or nature of the environment. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 14; Conference name: 2013 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2013; Conference date: 28 May 2013 through 28 May 2013; Conference code: 98737&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

In this paper we present a project that focuses on incidents, that are caused by uncontrolled emissions of liquid or gaseous contaminants (e.g. explosive or toxic gases or liquids, biological, chemical or nuclear weapons). Instead of sending specially equipped forces with expensive transport and measurement devices into the contaminated area, our proposed system makes use of an autonomous, wireless connected swarm of Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAV), often simply known as drones, that are featured with lightweight mobile sensor systems. In this paper we will be particularly focusing on the complex communication system, which on the one hand has to organize the on-board-communication between the control systems of the MUAV and the sensors and on the other hand has to establish wireless connections to the mission control center on the ground as well as to neighboring MUAVs in the air via a mesh network. © 2009 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 107; Correspondence Address: K.

A typical scenario is massive crowd management of the multi-millions annual Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca where UAVs are widely utilized to conduct crowd monitoring by carrying sensory devices. The safe flight of a UAV is crucial for ensuring the successful execution of missions. With the aim to overcome the disadvantage caused by the ground station intrusion detection, the combination of UAV and airborne LiDAR has been widely studied in the field of UAV obstacle recognition. This article studies the UAV network architecture under a common scenario and proposes an obstacle recognition and intrusion detection algorithm for UAV based on an airborne LiDAR (ALORID). First, the preprocessing of the data obtained by a LiDAR, i.e., the coordinate conversion of LiDAR data in combination with UAV motion parameters, is completed. Then, the LiDAR data graph at the current moment is generated by the image noisy point filtering algorithm. After that, the improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used for image clustering of intrusions to obtain the LiDAR time-domain cumulative graph in a certain detection time. Finally, the motion recognition and location detection of each cluster are completed. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in identifying the moving state of the intrusions.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

However, selection of propagation models in FANETs is always a challenge due to its wireless shared links, individual drone’s mobility, limited power, etc. Hence, in this paper, we study propagation models for performance comparison of routing protocols in FANETs. Specifically, we study and present simulation results of Lutz and ITU Recommendation series to compare Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) and Destination Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV), two widely used routing protocols in FANETs considering rain attenuation.

To address this problem, we propose a collaborative hierarchical Multi-Agent model based on two layers (Administrant layer and Autonomous layer), which makes use of the knowledge-based communication to actualize interaction in this model. Task planning and allocation are implemented in the administrant layer by using U-Tree algorithm, where reward function and evaluation value are introduced to control selection factors. Agents are allowed to work together using architectures like swarm and information update value in the autonomous layer, so that centralized and decentralized control can be integrated effectively.

In scenarios such as intrusion detection, target tracking and facility monitoring it is important to reach a given area of interest (AOI), and create an online data streaming connection to a monitoring ground station (GS) for immediate delivery of content to the operator. In previous work, we showed that a multi-hop line network can increase the range of the mission by finding the optimal number of relay UAVs, and their optimal placement. In this demo, we show that CSMA (typical 802.11's medium access protocol) behaves poorly in this type of networks due to mutual interference, and that TDMA is a better alternative.

These swarms can directly contact via ground control station or direct communication. However, when communicating remotely via wireless and fine maneuverability of the unmanned aerial vehicle, many mechanisms face several security gaps, such as the authentication mechanism in enemy attacks. In this study, we propose safe and effective authentication mechanism appropriate for the dynamic environment of the unmanned aerial vehicle. In the frames of this approach, a new operating mechanism in the proposed protocol is described. The protocol provides authentication security for swarms of the unmanned aerial vehicle. Our scheme allows good communication and computing performance as well as storage cost. Finally, simulation and results in the communication environment between drones are presented. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2020; Conference date: 1 December 2020 through 4 December 2020; Conference code: 166370&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2020, December 1, 2020 - December 4, 2020&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Symp.

Though present day UAVs are equipped with GPS, the UAVs have to rely only on navigation information obtained from inertial navigation system while operating in GPS denied environments. This research work, addresses the problem of establishing a GPS protected wireless MAV network (WIMAN) using three classes of navigation system, one equipped only with GPS, an other equipped only with high accuracy inertial navigation system and the third equipped with relatively low accuracy inertial navigation system, to enable missions in GPS denied environments. NP hardness in establishing GPS protected WIMAN architecture is discussed and a heuristic algorithm is proposed. Group coordination and tactical replan procedures, that enable WIMAN to maintain its configuration, reconfiguration to adapt to various phases of cooperative threat reconnaissance mission, is demonstrated through simulation results.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</research-notes><custom3>2016 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The agents will be organized in clusters in order to carry out such missions; different clusters may execute different missions simultaneously. During the mission, the unmanned agents are supported by sensors on the ground and in the air, and can receive commands and send information back to a command ship, say. It is clear that efficient communications between agents, and from agents to sensors and to command posts are critical to mission success. The goal of the Minuteman project is to develop the concept and initial prototype of an agile, dynamic, multi-layer "Internet in the sky" architecture that can deliver the "forward power" of the unmanned missions. The architecture consists of a high speed, wireless mobile backbone network (MBN) - with point-to-point wireless links. and local access networks feeding to backbone nodes. The design is extremely challenging because of the hostile environment, the need for QoS support and the unpredictable nature of the requirements. The focus of this paper is on scalable addressing and routing in such a multiplayer mobile environment where UAVs can fly at speeds exceeding several hundreds miles per hour. We exploit the fact that agents typically move in groups, and achieve scalability by keeping track of a "landmark" for each group. This is done using LANMAR, a land-mark ad hoc routing scheme. The LANMAR scheme originally developed for "flat" ad hoc networks extends naturally to a network with a physical backbone. Via simulation we show that LANMAR maintains robust, resilient. rapidly restored connectivity in the face of agent mobility.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference</research-notes><custom3>Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

UAV ad hoc networks have the potential to provide reliable and real-time services using single-hop or multi-hop communications. However, the network topology of a UAV ad-hoc network is highly dynamic because of the fast flying UAVs that result in short lived communication links between UAVs. In mission critical applications, small delays could result in catastrophic outcomes. Thus it is required for UAVs to exchange their information as quickly as possible (with shortest possible delay). In this paper, we evaluate the performance of UAV ad hoc networks by considering the effect of network size on throughput, energy consumption and effective transmission range (total coverage range). Numerical results obtained from simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of UAV ad hoc networks. Our results show that when network size (the number of UAVs) increases, the throughput per UAV and energy consumption decrease while the total network transmission range (effective coverage range) increases.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: SoutheastCon 2015&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: SoutheastCon 2015</research-notes><custom3>SoutheastCon 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

It provides two-way communication, either upon demand or on a continuous basis. An up-link provides control of the air vehicle flight path and commands to its payloads. The downlink provides both a low data rate channel to acknowledge commands and transmit status information about the aerial vehicle and a high data rate channel for payload data such as video, radar and navigation. In this paper we describe a novel secured, two way, high speed RF command and video data link system which enables real time, high speed, continuous data exchange between aircraft/missile/high dynamic vehicles and ground entities and vice-versa. This system uses advanced spread spectrum modulation, spread spectrum coding and decoding techniques to ensure signal security and multi-user access. This paper also discusses the RF data link system design issues faced in its development and the methods, technologies employed to overcome these challenges. It describes the system Architecture, behavioral operation and validation of the system. It also details successful demonstration of the technology and future plans for improvement of signal security and range of operation.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference</research-notes><custom3>IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N.

The drones are divided into four groups, each of 25 drones. Each drone is connected to a wireless access point where the mission control center operates the command to each drone individually in parallel to display the expected letter or words. Python is the programming language used for commanding and controlling the operation. The communication between drones and the mission control computer is done wirelessly with Wi-FiS02.11N technology running at a 2. 4GHz frequency. Each drone is assigned to a specific IP address as an ID based on the unique Media Access Control (MAC) address. To communicate with the drones, the User Diagram Protocol (UDP) protocol is used for the communication.

To ensure robustness, previous works propose sending a robot to the neighboring area in case it detects a failure. In order to add unpredictability and to improve on the efficiency in the deterministic patrolling scheme, this paper presents random strategies to cover the areas distributed among the agents. We evaluate these strategies using three metrics: the idle-time, the isolation-time and the broadcast-time. The idle-time is the expected time between two consecutive observations of any point of the terrain. The isolation-time is the expected time that a robot is isolated (that is, without communication with any other robot). The broadcast-time is the expected time elapsed from the moment a robot emits a message until it is received by all the other robots of the team. Simulations show that the random strategies outperform the results obtained with the deterministic protocol.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</research-notes><custom3>2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

If the data under consideration is an emergency message such as a fire alarm, it must be transmitted as fast and reliably as possible towards the sink of WSN. In such mission critical applications, it may not be enough to have one static sink but there will be multiple and mobile sinks. Sinks can be associated to first responders such as firefighters, but also to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The existing approaches have a high communication cost and a high delivery latency, which makes them less suitable for emergency situations. As an alternative to existing protocols, we present Honeycomb Architecture and Hexagonal Tiling-Based Data Dissemination (HexDD) protocol for emergency message transmission in mobile multi-sink WSNs. Simulation results show that HexDD has a high data delivery ratio and a very low data delivery latency, which are major requirements for disaster management scenarios.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 The 9th IFIP Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 The 9th IFIP Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)&#xD;&#xD;UAVs are only tackled on the side&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49786/A.

In swarm robotics, a self-organized cooperation is applied, where robots with limited intelligence cooperate and interact locally to build up the desired global behavior. In this paper, we are studying a mobile object tracking scenario performed by a swarm of robots. The robustness, scalability and flexibility of swarm robots make it an attractive approach for missions like object tracking in complex and dynamic environments. As the individual robot capabilities are limited in swarm systems, the robots may not be able to track the mobile object continuously. This limitation is overcome using the robots communication capability. In order to increase the probability of object detection, we propose a greedy self-deployment strategy, where the robots are spread uniformly in the environment to be monitored. For detecting a moving target, the robots use a biologically inspired algorithm for collecting robots currently located in other regions to track the target. In such cooperative tasks the robots normally need to be time synchronized for simultaneous activation. A new proposal for time synchronization in swarm robots is introduced which exploits the mobility of the robots for handling possible disconnections in the network and synchronize them at the beginning of tracking time slots.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 14th IEEE International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing Workshops&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 14th IEEE International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing Workshops</research-notes><custom3>2011 14th IEEE International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing Workshops</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The large number of small vehicles motivates novel design choices for state estimation and communication. For state estimation, we develop a method to reliably track many small rigid bodies with identical motion-capture marker arrangements. Our communication infrastructure uses compressed one-way data flow and supports a large number of vehicles per radio. We achieve reliable flight with accurate tracking (&lt; 2 cm mean position error) by implementing the majority of computation onboard, including sensor fusion, control, and some trajectory planning. We provide various examples and empirically determine latency and tracking performance for swarms with up to 49 vehicles. © 2017 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 219; Conference name: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2017; Conference date: 29 May 2017 through 3 June 2017; Conference code: 129533; CODEN: PIIAE&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2017, May 29, 2017 - June 3, 2017&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc IEEE Int Conf Rob Autom&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2017, May 29, 2017 - June 3, 2017</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027964932&amp;doi=10.1109%2fICRA.2017.7989376&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e193894989f47bf83524b931eba9eb66</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989376</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Singapore, Singapore</custom1><custom3>2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2017, May 29, 2017 - June 3, 2017</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The cooperative formation control technology of intelligent driving vehicle is the basic requirement of intelligent transportation system, and is also the key technology of intelligent driving vehicle formation control. The existing research on intelligent vehicle queue control focuses more on the control performance of a single vehicle queue, but less on the collaborative control of multiple intelligent vehicle queues.

For the designed DLAA-VANETs, we investigate the UAV deployment and network optimization problems. In particular, a UAV deployment scheme based on particle swarm optimization is presented. Then, the NOMA technique is introduced into the designed architecture, which can improve the transmission rate. Afterward, we take the information security into account and formulate a downlink total transmission rate maximization problem by optimizing UAV height and subcarrier allocation. For tackling this non-convex problem, we decouple this downlink total transmission rate maximization problem as two subproblems, where UAV height and subcarrier allocation problems are solved in turn. Moreover, the transmission performance of the designed DLAA-VANETs is analyzed, based on which the security outage probability (SOP) is derived. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the presented UAV deployment scheme can maximize the relay coverage ratio. In addition, the proposed can achieve a higher downlink total transmission rate in comparison with the current works.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

The proposed COMORL scheme controls BOs for CRE to maximize the number of user equipments (UEs) that satisfy their quality of service (QoS) requirements, especially in terms of delay and data rates. For this purpose, we developed a QoS satisfaction indicator that measures a violation of delay requirements by considering both QoS requirements and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In addition, we formulated a Markov decision process (MDP) model that is solved with a cooperative multi-agent online reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed COMORL scheme maximizes the global utility for load-coupled base stations. Our simulation results verify the proposed COMORL scheme’s effectiveness in terms of throughput, delay satisfaction ratio, and fairness. Specifically, we verify that the proposed COMORL scheme achieves a maximum of approximately 27% and 30% improvement of the delay satisfaction ratio, which is how many UEs satisfy their delay requirement among all of the UEs in a serving BS under medium and full traffic loads, respectively, in a dynamic scenario in comparison to the max-SINR scheme.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Unsure if this paper is relevant since it is using reinforcement learning&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

The proposed hybrid framework 'Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration Aquila Optimizer' (CME-AO) is a unique combination of both deterministic Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration (CME) and a swarm based methodology, known as Aquila Optimizer (AO). A novel parallel communication protocol is also embedded to improve multi-robot space exploration process while simultaneously minimizing both the computation complexity and time. This ensures acquisition of a optimal collision-free path in a barrier-filled environment via generating a finite map. The architecture starts by determining the cost and utility values of neighbouring cells around the robot using deterministic CME. Aquila Optimization technique is then incorporated to increase the overall solution accuracy. Numerous simulations under different environmental conditions were then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Algorithm consistency aspects in achieving the expected results (area explored rate and time) is demonstrated through statistical means. A perspective analysis is then performed by comparing the performance of the CME-AO algorithm with latest state of art contemporary algorithms namely conventional CME and CME-WO (CME Whale Optimizer). The comparison duly accommodates all pertinent aspects such as % area explored, number of failed runs, and time taken for map exploration for different environments. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents two distinct advantages over the other conventional state of the art CME based techniques a) enhanced map exploration in cluttered environment and b) significantly reduced computation complexity and execution time, with almost no fail runs. This makes the suggested methodology particularly suitable for on-board utilization in an obstacle-cluttered environment, where other techniques either fails (stuck locally) or takes longer exploration time.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: I.

A two-phase control is devised which, under appropriate individual bounds, almost surely leads to successful rendezvous. We examine a likely and practical initial distribution, which leads to an exploration protocol wherein an agent is obligated to stay within a certain range of its initial position. Furthermore, the rate of convergence is primarily limited to the velocity limitations of the agents. We solve the aggregation and rendezvous problem with random initial conditions in an arbitrary, unbounded 2D domain without an a priori share coordinate system. We examine rates of successful aggregation under certain initial distributions, and rates of convergence under uncertain communication.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 50th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 50th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference</research-notes><custom3>2011 50th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

First, the node structure and deployment application of WSNs are analyzed, and the architecture of UAV collaborative data collection is designed. Second, the related models of communication energy consumption between WSNs' network and UAV cluster, UAV cluster task allocation, and path planning are established successively. Then, a simple but efficient task planning strategy considering UAV forward and return distances is proposed. Finally, for the problem of model solving, the solution strategy of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed. The simulation results verify that the strategy reduces the overall network energy consumption by 42.16% and the total range of UAV by 9.7% and realizes the relative minimization of WSNs energy consumption and UAV flight cost on the premise of ensuring the full coverage of WSNs' nodes.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: H.

Under this perspective, enemy forces will seek to disable or disturb our autonomous Things and our complex infrastructures and systems. Autonomy, scale and complexity in our defense systems will trigger new cyber-attack strategies, and autonomous intelligent malware (AIM) will be part of the picture. Should these cyber-attacks succeed while human operators remain unaware or unable to react fast enough due to the speed, scale or complexity of the mission, systems or attacks, missions would fail, our networks and C4ISR would be heavily disrupted, and command and control would be disabled. New cyber-defense doctrines and technologies are therefore required. Autonomous cyber defense (ACyD) is a new field of research and technology driven by the defense sector in anticipation of such threats to future military infrastructures, systems and operations. It will be implemented via swarms of autonomous intelligent cyber-defense agents (AICAs) that will fight AIM within our networks and systems. This paper presents this cyber-defense technology of the future, the current state of the art in this field and its main challenges. First, we review the rationale of the ACyD concept and its associated AICA technology. Then, we present the current research results from NATO's IST-152 Research Task Group on the AICA Reference Architecture. We then develop the 12 main technological challenges that must be resolved in the coming years, besides ethical and political issues. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Conference name: 2019 IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2019; Conference date: 12 November 2019 through 14 November 2019; Conference code: 158374; CODEN: PMICE&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: MILCOM 2019 - 2019 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: MILCOM 2019 - 2019 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082387176&amp;doi=10.1109%2fMILCOM47813.2019.9021038&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=def016a9db6c23ed9dc8bc7df82cdb24</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>MILCOM 2019 - 2019 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

For small UAS, several operational rules have been established under FAR Part 107 (e.g., do not operate beyond visual line-of-sight, do not fly within five miles of a commercial airport, do not fly above 400 ft above ground level). However, there is no current means of enforcing these rules with a high degree of assurance. This paper summarizes testing of an onboard system - Safeguard - designed to monitor and enforce conformance to a set of geospatial limitations defined prior to flight (e.g., geospatial stay-out or stay-in regions, and altitude constraints). Unlike typical geo-fencing or geo-limitation functions, Safeguard operates independently of the off-the-shelf UAS autopilot and is designed in a way that can be realized by a small set of verifiable functions to simplify compliance with existing standards for safety-critical systems (e.g., for spacecraft and manned commercial transportation aircraft). A framework is described that decouples the system from any other devices on the UAS as well as introduces complementary positioning source(s) for applications that require integrity and availability beyond what can be provided by the onboard Global Positioning System (GPS)-based navigation solution. This paper presents results of analyses of flight data collected during Safeguard testing since initial presentation of the design concept at the 35th DASC (2016) and further development and testing at the 36th DASC (2017). Over this timeframe, numerous flight tests were completed on multiple unmanned aircraft (including multi-rotor and fixed wing) with each performing various mission types (e.g., infrastructure inspections, low altitude flights over populated/urban areas, and extended visual line-of-sight flights). Findings will focus on quantifying the performance of the system in support of validation of assurance claims, as well as demonstration of advanced technology readiness level (TRL). Integration testing with NASA's UAS Traffic Management (UTM) service-oriented architecture was also demonstrated during many of these flights; allowing performance results for this capability to also be presented. The paper will conclude with plans for future research and development, including evaluating the use of alternate positioning systems, extending the conformance monitoring criteria, and embedding the functions into a more holistic runtime assurance system concept.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)</research-notes><custom3>2018 IEEE/AIAA 37th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.

In establishing drone swarms, secure communication between a fog drone and several edge drones is essential to mutually authenticate each other. Although many research works proposed the designs of mutual authentications, none of them meets the adequate security for the drone swarm environments, requiring either involvement of the ground station during the authentication process or expensive PKI-based crypto operations. Only a few works proposed more lightweight authentication, however, they are still vulnerable to key compromises in addition to the limited flexibility and scalability. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable authentication protocol for fog-edge drone swarm environments, enabling mutual authentication between fog and edges without involving the ground station. We also show the design can leverage various hardware-assisted security functions. Protocol evaluations show security requirements satisfaction while achieving 14–20 times less computation overhead as compared to PKI-based models. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: K.

The swarm can consist of many small-size aerial, ground, or space vehicles (or robots) and they may be interconnected through data links or communication networks to perform common tasks. The interconnected AV systems may each have coupled mechanical-electromagnetic dynamics, aerodynamics, thermal dynamics and control interactions. This d-HIL testbed facilitates the easy connections of real-time simulation models implemented on different hardware or at different locations, controller hardware at a remote or field location, and simulated or real hardware systems under test. A human operator can also be connected into the simulation loop to provide input to the test procedure. Testing of these functional components in a high-fidelity virtual environment will help make corrections or refinement to the control algorithms and software with high confidence before moving to field test and overcome the cost and safety concerns. This platform is based upon heterogeneous computing hardware, such as real-time multi-core processors and FPGA (field programmable gate array), and open-source simulation packages such as PX4 and ROS2. The developed software consists of computational modules for dynamic simulation, control implementation, data visualization, and data communications through different network protocols. The testbed is applicable to rapid virtual testing of networked dynamic systems such as aerospace systems, swarms of drones/ robots, microgrids, etc. In the dynamic simulation, mathematical models of different components can be solved by a set of multi-rate computational solvers and running on hardware units with different simulation time steps, depending on the model’s time scale. These innovative computational solvers can find the solutions to various transient physical phenomena or processes based on the first principles, or capture and quantify the input-output relationships based on machine learning models. Several case studies will demonstrate the use of this platform in coordinated simulation of swarms of drones and robots and show the results of different simulation scenarios, involving several key components in autonomous flight or robot missions. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Precursor missions have frequently been used as both technological testbeds and implementers of prerequisite infrastructure to support future missions as part of an incremental space exploration strategy. While Mars presents a new opportunity for human exploration and long-term missions, it also presents new logistical challenges in mission planning and execution. This is due to environmental, communications, and resource availability challenges not experienced with manned missions within the Earth system. Consequently, missions designed for exploration and scouting of areas of interest before the arrival of humans become a necessity. This paper presents a vehicle design and mission architecture for a rapid, cost-efficient, and redundant scout system for high-fidelity mapping and exploration of mission areas. A swarm robotics approach utilizing highly modular, simplified rover platforms and existing commercially available equipment are able to autonomously build 3D maps of large swaths of terrain that include information on topology, mineral concentrations, ambient conditions, and additional data pertinent to mission planning and in-situ resource utilization. Standardized buses with plug-and-play payload racks allow for use of variable payloads to suit mission needs without changes to overall design or logistics. This modular, redundant design represents a considerably valuable mechanism for increasing cost-efficiency and chance of mission-success of interplanetary operations from early-planning to end of mission life.

Orchestrating these systems towards a successful mission, especially in contested environments, requires strict synchronization and reliable communication among network entities. Although using a ground controller with a long range link provides a cost-effective solution, it is extremely vulnerable to single-point of failure and/or jamming attacks. Thus, in contested environments, adapting ad-hoc policies is one of the most promising approaches, mitigating these vulnerabilities. However, existing ad-hoc approaches fail to sustain multi-hop connections, suffering from frequent topology changes and intermittent links due to dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose self-organizing TDMA (STDMA) protocol for aerial swarms in order to ensure reliable communication through efficient network management. We also partially implement our protocol on a small-scale test-bed and show that how drones are able to self-configure upon joining the network without any prior information. Our proposed STDMA protocol improves the overall channel utilization up to 55 percent with less control traffic overhead compared to the existing studies.  © 2022 ACM.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: E.E.

The dynamic task assignment model for the UAV swarm with the topology of distributed subsets is established considering multiple constraints such as task cooperation, performing sequence, dynamic environment, communication topology, payload model, and UAV capability. According to the characteristics of multi-participants and multi-tasks in the process of UAV swarm executing tasks, the determination mechanism on cooperators and the selection mechanism of sequential tasks are proposed, and then the contract network protocol is extended. On the basis of the above, an event-triggered task assignment strategy for dynamic tasks is designed. The simulated results show that the proposed method can achieve the cooperative dynamic assignment of the UAV swarm to perform reconnaissance-and-attack tasks to multi-targets in complex and uncertain combat scenarios, improve the adaptiveness of the swarm under the sudden circumstance, and realize the optimization for task execution efficiency of the UAV swarm. © 2022 by the authors.

The platform consists of loosely coupled components interacting via message brokers, which we evaluate through a pair of real-life experiments that emulate reference use-cases. We then look into the performance of drone-to-ground communications, with a particular focus on latency. We implement a dedicated, low-resource communications module with efficient serialization protocols and asynchronous message handling, to compare against the built-in message broker approach.

This is due to the robustness and versatility they present to effectively undertake a set of tasks autonomously. One of the essential elements for several vehicles, in this case, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), to perform tasks autonomously and cooperatively is trajectory planning, which is necessary to guarantee the safe and collision-free movement of the different vehicles. This document includes the planning of multiple trajectories for a swarm of UAVs based on 3D Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM). This swarm is capable of reaching different locations of interest in different cases (labeled and unlabeled), supporting of an Emergency Response Team (ERT) in emergencies in urban environments. In addition, an architecture based on Robot Operating System (ROS) is presented to allow the simulation and integration of the methods developed in a UAV swarm. This architecture allows the communications with the MavLink protocol and control via the Pixhawk autopilot, for a quick and easy implementation in real UAVs. The proposed method was validated by experiments simulating building emergences. Finally, the obtained results show that methods based on probability roadmaps create effective solutions in terms of calculation time in the case of scalable systems in different situations along with their integration into a versatile framework such as ROS. © 2020 by the authors.

The effects of perturbations are mainly on stability of mission and network topological effects can be prominently observed by comparing difference in mission completion time for different network topologies including directed, undirected, probabilistic, dynamic and static networks.

Complex formation configurations can be of interest to be the central element in an exhibition or maximize surface coverage for surveillance of a specific area. Existing algorithms that enable complex configurations usually require a centralized control, a communication protocol among the swarm in order to achieve consensus, or predefined instructions for individual agents. Nonetheless, trivial shapes such as flocks can be accomplished with low sensing and interaction requirements. We propose a pattern formation algorithm that enables a variety of shape configurations with a distributed, communication-free and index-free implementation with collision avoidance. Our algorithm is based on a formation definition that does not require indexing of the agents. We show the potential of the algorithm by simulating the formation of non-trivial shapes such as a wedge and a T-shaped configuration. We compare the performance of the algorithm for single and double integrator models for the dynamics of the agents. Finally, we run a preliminary test of our algorithm by implementing it with a group of small cars equipped with a Lidar for sensing and orientation calculation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The primary reason for this increase is that UAVs eliminate the risk to human life in difficult and dangerous missions, are cost effective, and easily are deployed. Developments in UAV technology and decreasing costs have increased UAV usage. However, when multiple UAVs are deployed, inter UAV communication becomes complicated. For this reason, communication in multi-UAV systems is the most important problem that needs to be solved. To enable communication among UAVs without infrastructure support, a Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) is used. A FANET provides UAVs to fly in tandem without colliding. To ensure coordinated flight, UAVs require the location information of other UAVs. In this study, we developed a common channel multi-token circulation protocol to share location information in multi-UAV systems that communicate using a FANET. The proposed method ensures that UAVs in multi-UAV systems know each other's coordinate information with minimum error. © 2019 Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Cooperative, multiple robots are employed for many different tasks to increase the efficiency and success of a mission. However, many of the existing collective path planning approaches do not guarantee a reliable escape in environments with complex, non-convex obstacles without any prior knowledge. In this study, we developed a navigation framework for multi-robot systems in unknown areas that solely exploit the sensing information and shared data among the agents. The key contribution of this paper is the simultaneous, collision-free motion planning for fully autonomous robots in a collective manner. Furthermore, our communication architecture enables the robots to find an appropriate path to a desired, joint target position, despite the limited sensing and communication range.

Device swarms are smart, mobile, and interconnected devices that operate in large numbers and are likely to be part of emerging applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). Swarm devices process and exchange safety, privacy, and mission-critical information. Thus, it is important to have a good code verification technique that scales to device swarms and establishes trust among collaborating devices. DADS has several advantages over current state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques: It is decentralized, has no single point of failure, and can handle changing topologies after nodes are compromised. DADS assures system resilience to node compromise/failure while guaranteeing only devices that execute genuine code remain part of the group. We conduct performance measurements of communication, computation, memory, and energy using the TrustLite embedded systems architecture in OMNeT++ simulation environment. We show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce communication cost and is very efficient in terms of computation, memory, and energy requirements. We also analyze security and show that DADS is very effective and robust against various attacks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://dl-acm-org.proxy1-bib.sdu.dk/doi/pdf/10.1145/3325822</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3325822</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Atman, M.

This paper investigates two similar architectures for a semi-autonomous robotic swarm under a passivity-short assumption of the human operator. The two architectures differ only in the visual feedback given to the human operator. In addition, we present the proofs that both architectures ensure the objective which is position/velocity synchronization of the robotic swarm to references determined by the human. Further analysis in differences between both architectures is then presented, by considering the same velocity command from the human operator and inspecting the visual feedbacks of each architecture. In addition, the effects on the transparency of all robots' actual trajectories to the visual feedback are also discussed. Finally, investigation involving several test-subjects is conducted by using human-in-the-loop simulation to investigate human responses on both architectures. © 2018 The Society of Instrument and Control Engineers - SICE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Conference name: 2018 SICE International Symposium on Control Systems, SICE ISCS 2018; Conference date: 9 March 2018 through 11 March 2018; Conference code: 135731&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 SICE International Symposium on Control Systems, SICE ISCS 2018, March 9, 2018 - March 11, 2018&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: SICE ISCS - SICE Int.

In this paper is investigated a collective task that requires a multi-robot system to search for randomly distributed mines in an unknown environment and disarm them cooperatively. The communication among the swarm of robots influences the overall performance in terms of time to execute the task or consumed energy. To address this problem, a new distributed recruiting protocol to coordinate a swarm of robots in demining mission, is described. This problem is a multi-objective problem and two bio inspired strategies are used. The novelty of this approach lies in the combination of direct and indirect communication: on one hand an indirect communication among robots is used for the exploration of the environment, on the other hand a novel protocol is used to accomplish the recruiting and coordination of the robots for demining task. This protocol attempts to tackle the question of how autonomous robot can coordinate themselves into an unknown environment relying on simple low-level capabilities. The strategy is able to adapt the current system dynamics if the number of robots or the environment structure or both change. The proposed approach has been implemented and has been evaluated in several simulated environments. We analyzed the impact of our approach in the overall performance of a robot team. Experimental results indicated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed protocol to spread the robots in the environment. © 2016 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Conference name: Unmanned Systems Technology XVIII; Conference date: 20 April 2016 through 21 April 2016; Conference code: 123547; CODEN: PSISD&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XVIII&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Unmanned Systems Technology XVIII, April 20, 2016 - April 21, 2016&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Unmanned Systems Technology XVIII, April 20, 2016 - April 21, 2016</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987849523&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.2228859&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b7dc1bfb4058776120a56ca5c787c3fa</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2228859</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Baltimore, MD, United states</custom1><custom3>Unmanned Systems Technology XVIII, April 20, 2016 - April 21, 2016</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, C.</author><author>Zhang, K.</author><author>Jiang, Y.</author><author>Niu, S.</author><author>Yang, T.</author><author>Song, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication aware uav swarm surveillance based on hierarchical architecture</title><secondary-title>Drones</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drones</full-title><abbr-1>Drones-Basel</abbr-1></periodical><pages>33</pages><volume>5</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Communication aware UAV formation</keyword><keyword>Dynamical object tracking</keyword><keyword>Hierarchical architecture of UAV teaming</keyword><keyword>Intercommunication quality</keyword><keyword>Persistent surveillance</keyword><keyword>persistent surveillance</keyword><keyword>OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>ALLOCATION</keyword><keyword>communication aware UAV formation</keyword><keyword>dynamical object tracking</keyword><keyword>hierarchical architecture of UAV teaming</keyword><keyword>intercommunication quality</keyword><keyword>SIMULATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>JUN 2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2504446X (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/drones5020033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Multi-agent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teaming becomes an essential part in science mission, modern warfare surveillance, and disaster rescuing. This paper proposes a decentralized UAV swarm persistent monitoring strategy in realizing continuous sensing coverage and network service. A two-layer (high altitude and low altitude) UAV teaming hierarchical structure is adopted in realizing the accurate object tracking in the area of interest (AOI). By introducing the UAV communication channel model in its path planning, both centralized and decentralized control schemes would be evaluated in the waypoint tracking simulation. The UAV swarm network service and object tracking are measured by metrics of communication link quality and waypoints tracking accuracy. UAV swarm network connectivity are evaluated over different aspects, such as stability and volatility. The comparison of proposed algorithms is presented with simulations. The result shows that the decentralized scheme outperforms the centralized scheme in the mission of persistent surveillance, especially on maintaining the stability of inner UAV swarm network while tracking moving objects. © 2021 by the authors.

The nonlinear dynamic system bifurcation theory together with artificial potential field (APF) method is applied. Artificial control force field is designed so that the system has desired bifurcation and stability characteristics to achieve different formation configurations or formation reconfiguration. Static bifurcating artificial potential fields is designed by using hyperbolic-exponential function to accomplish different static formations. The stability of the formation is verified through theoretical proof using Lyapunov method and local linearization method. In addition, the linear coordinate transformation and redefining of the relative position vector are introduced to generate nonspherically symmetrical potential field so as to realize formation distortion and some non-uniform formations. Different cases of formation flying of swarm with 30 spacecraft are simulated. Numerical results show that the proposed method can achieve many different formation configurations, such as single circle and ellipse, double concentric circle and ellipse, disc elliptical disc, diamond and etc. Each spacecraft moves cooperatively with all the other spacecraft "naturally", without direct communication between each other and any extra external orders or centralized planning and control. The presented method to form the swarm configuration diversity, is of great significance for future engineering practice. Copyright © 2017 by International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

This article presents a toolset that can perform an over-the-air code update of the robots in a swarm while the swarm is active, without interrupting the swarm's mission. Each update is generated as a patch of the currently deployed code. A consensus mechanism borrowed from swarm intelligence ensures that, at any given time, all robots in the swarm run the same code version. Simulations were conducted with thousands of units to study the scalability and bandwidth consumption of the update process. Real deployment experiments were then performed on a small swarm of commercial quadcopters.

These next generation multi-vehicle UAV systems work as a collaborative autonomous unit, receiving only high-level mission commands, and require little human intervention for control. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) is involved in a multi-year R&amp;D program to develop "strong autonomy" based on innovative scalable architectures for high-level autonomy and emergent group behavior in distributed vehicle systems that include both UAVs and small robots. JHU/APL has developed a reliable, robust communications architecture to manage the input and output of "belief" messages. This architecture comprises the content, structure, prioritization, broadcast scheduling, and reception of these messages. The architecture also includes the physical wireless link between vehicles, which for these proof-of-concept demonstrations is an ad hoc IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network (WLAN). The communications architecture supports three primary services: Periodic Packet Multicast service, On-Demand Packet Broadcast service, and Operation, Administration, and Management (OAM) service. The former two services are for transport of beliefs. The OAM service allows configuration of internal default parameters and allows access to its internal status and statistical counters. The architecture provides these services by supporting three interfaces: the Belief Transmit Service Interface (BTSI), Belief Receive Service Interlace (BRSI), and OAM Interface (OAMI). Along with the architecture description, this paper presents actual field demonstration results of multiple ground and aerial vehicle systems.

Its purpose is to carry out complex missions involving Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Suppression of Enemy Aerial Defenses (SEAD), Destruction of Enemy Aerial Defenses (DEAD), Close Air Support (CAS), and other functions in an environment characterized by large uncertainty and vehicle loss or failures. Our approach is referred to as the Collaborative Mission Planning &amp; Autonomous Control Technology (CoMPACT) encompassing tasks and objectives from the mission planning stage to the UAV task execution level. The main advantage of the CoMPACT system is that it effectively combines mission planning using evolutionary algorithms, hybrid automata-based task execution, and biologically-inspired emergent swarm behaviors. Judicious combination and coordination of these capabilities results in a system that is scalable to architectures involving a very large number of autonomous agents in which mission-relevant objectives are accomplished in highly uncertain dynamic environments through real-time mission re-planning, dynamic agent-to-task assignment, and reactive motion planning. Through simulation and experiment, the CoMPACT approach is shown to be robust to intermittent loss of communications and communication delays, and to dynamic changes in the environment such as moving targets, unknown targets and obstacles, pop-up threats, vehicular failures and loss of agents. The CoMPACT system has been extensively tested on a Matlab simulation of a realistic mission scenario involving ISR, SEAD and DEAD functions, and simple models of UAV dynamics operating in a dynamic threat and target-rich environment. The CoMPACT system has also been implemented and field tested for maritime applications in a companion AUVSI paper [42].</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: R.

As unmanned vehicles, communications and sensors have matured sufficiently to enable large field deployments, multiple unmanned vehicles (UxVs) performing a single unified mission becomes achievable. This new paradigm requires reliable information sharing and coordination in ad-hoc, unreliable and/or low-bandwidth environments, the ability to collaboratively achieve coordinated goals, and autonomous adaptation to uncertain, dynamic environments. Our approach implements a distributed agent architecture, wherein mission CONOPS and rules of engagement are represented by agent roles, behaviors and actions. System performance is scalable to hundreds of nodes by progressively limiting the scope of distributed information according to collaborative need or relevance. Autonomous field management provides for long-term persistence and performance via adaptation, replenishment, and in-situ recharging. This paper will present our collaborative autonomy software architecture, including mechanisms for abstracting field behaviors from platform capabilities, and maintaining field performance under possible field attrition. Implementation of our approach for collaborative, heterogeneous UAV air mission is presented as a concept illustration. An application of CoMPACT to swarms of UAVs performing a complex ISR and SEAD mission is presented in a companion AUVSI paper [1].</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: R.

Each UAV in the team uses inertial sensor and terrain sensor information to simultaneously localise the UAV while building a point feature map of the surrounding terrain, where map information is shared between vehicles over a data fusion network. Multi-vehicle active SLAM control architectures are proposed that actively plan the trajectories and motions of each of the vehicles in the team based on maximising information in the localisation and mapping estimates. We demonstrate and compare an ideal, centralised architecture, where a central planning node chooses optimal actions for each UAV, and a coordinated, decentralised architecture, where UAVs make their own control decisions based on common shared map information. The different architectures involve varying degrees of complexity and optimality through differing communications and computational requirements. Results are presented using a three-UAV team in a six-degree of freedom multi-UAV simulator. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 33; Correspondence Address: M.

For instance, it could be possible to have a team of UAV acting as weather sensors improving the performance of a SWIM weather application. In this context, and due to the autonomous nature of the UAVs, it is possible to embed autonomous decision-making tools in the software on-board the UAVs for providing services in the SWIM architecture. Furthermore, to increase the robustness of the system w.r.t. the communication infrastructure limitations, distributed autonomous decision tools are considered instead of centralized decision-making. An important issue in distributed multi-UAV coordination is the distributed task allocation problem that has recently become a key research topic. Our approach to the distributed task allocation problem considers the application of market-based negotiation rules. Based on this method, the UAVs themselves will autonomously decide which one will be endowed with each task. In the missions considered in the paper, a team of UAVs has to provide services to a SWIM application. Those services have been modeled by tasks consisting in visiting waypoints transmitting data in real time. The distributed execution of the algorithm applied in the paper will compute which UAV will visit each waypoint during the mission. Moreover, the algorithm will also create and allocate communication relay tasks if the limited communication range does not allow to send the data in real-time. The paper shows the result of several simulations considering different communication ranges.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 6th EUROCONTROL Innovative Research Workshop and Exhibition: Disseminating ATM Innovative Research; Conference date: 4 December 2007 through 6 December 2007; Conference code: 111416&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 6th EUROCONTROL Innovative Research Workshop and Exhibition: Disseminating ATM Innovative Research, December 4, 2007 - December 6, 2007&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: EUROCONTROL Innov.

Equipped with sensors and cameras, these technologies can perform much on-demand critical application ranging from military and environmental to rescue operations. These UAVs devices, sometimes tiny, that can replace human and manned aircraft in several tasks, have been utilized to perform various types of services and applications more efficiently. However, the deployment side of such emerging technology is still facing many issues and challenges. Using multi-drones or swarm of drones, together to accomplish one operation is one of these recent challenges. Such a system requires a high level of delicacy and cooperation to achieve the required autonomy and reduce human interaction as possible. Communication is one of the biggest challenges in these systems, since the devices should keep exchanging various types of messages with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, a collaborative autonomous system of swarm drones based on deep learning has been proposed and a testbed of cooperative UAVs' mission to validate the performance of the dedicated QoS communication system using Paparazzi drones The proposed system is aware of the drones' requirements in term of QoS and able to meet with their dynamic demands.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 17th ACM International Symposium on Mobility Management and Wireless Access, MobiWac 2019, November 25, 2019 - November 29, 2019&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: MOBIWAC'19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOBILITY MANAGEMENT AND WIRELESS ACCESS&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 17th ACM International Symposium on Mobility Management and Wireless Access&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 17th ACM International Symposium on Mobility Management and Wireless Access, MobiWac 2019, November 25, 2019 - November 29, 2019</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1145/3345770.3356740</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3345770.3356740</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Miami Beach, FL, United states</custom1><custom3>17th ACM International Symposium on Mobility Management and Wireless Access, MobiWac 2019, November 25, 2019 - November 29, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aljehani, Maher</author><author>Inoue, Masahiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication and autonomous control of multi-UAV system in disaster response tasks</title><tertiary-title>Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>11th KES International Conference on Agent and Multi-Agent Systems—Technologies and Applications, KES-AMSTA 2017, June 21, 2017 - June 23, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>123-132</pages><volume>74</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Aircraft detection</keyword><keyword>Rock mechanics</keyword><keyword>Aircraft control</keyword><keyword>Internet of things</keyword><keyword>Transmission control protocol</keyword><keyword>Aerial photography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH</publisher><isbn>21903018</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-59394-4_12</electronic-resource-num><abstract>After disasters occurrence, advanced technologies always play significant contributions to various disaster response tasks. For instance, utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for aerial imagery data helps to get a real-time monitoring system of the stricken areas. Recently, UAV is becoming a ubiquitous system and valuable technology in many civil applications, motivating researchers to endeavor to develop UAVs systems. Moreover, Internet of Things (IoT) has been employed to several study cases of disaster response. Using IoT to communicate, manage and control multiple UAVs after disaster occurrence is a real practical approach. However, this kind of integration wasnt clearly presented especially in the technical sides like communication and autonomous control. Consequently, this paper aims to reveal the scientific scenes of communications and controls between multiple UAVs and Ground Control Stations (GCSs). Due to an unexpected failure within a single UAV system, this study presents a multi-UAV system for scanning and tracking missions. Authors turned UAV to an IoT device by using embedded LTE dongle on the UAV control board. In the beginning of the paper, authors raised the issues of existing systems.

Multiple UAVs can cooperatively carry out dangerous applications for human operators or missions where human intervention is not needed, such as surveillance and monitoring of areas of interest and physical infrastructures. Due to the lack of proper communication rules and standards, communication remains one of the most crucial design issues for UAVs swarm. Furthermore, UAVs generally operate in frequency bands shared with other users. Hence, these spectral bands become overcrowded and UAVs may face a spectrum scarcity issue. To address the above challenges, it is essential to define a reliable communication architecture for multiple UAVs coordination and efficient bandwidth sharing. A promising technology that can satisfy the spectrum requirements of the emerging UAVs Networks is Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). The goal is to opportunistically use spectral bands with minimum interference to other users or applications, i.e., primary users. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum scarcity encountered by UAVs. We present a centralized CRN-based communication approach for UAVs-Ground Control Station (GCS) communication. The GCS is used as a central coordinator to handle bandwidth usage for the UAVs swarm in its coverage zone. It selects, allocates, and shares available frequencies using CRN and Software Defined Radio (SDR). To share the available CRN-frequency between the different UAVs in its scope, the GCS uses dynamic Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique. The performance of the proposed communication approach is evaluated in a surveillance context in terms of the total time required to transfer UAVs data, the total number of packets sent, and the achieved throughput.  2021 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108264</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Shuo</author><author>Shi, DongMei</author><author>Dong, Yu</author><author>Huang, Kai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Research on distributed task allocation of loitering munition swarm</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings - 2020 International Conference on Information Science, Parallel and Distributed Systems, ISPDS 2020</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2020 International Conference on Engineering Management of Communication and Technology, EMCTECH 2020, October 20, 2020 - October 22, 2020</full-title></periodical><pages>162-166</pages><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Ammunition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ISPDS51347.2020.00041</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the continuous development of unmanned systems swarm technology, the loitering munition swarm technology has gained wide attention from various countries for its unique combat advantages, and the task allocation technology is the key guarantee for its completion of combat missions.

Yet in order for the swarm members to work together effectively they must maintain a reliable and robust wireless communication network among them. The goal of this project is to investigate motion control laws which fulfill the dual and sometimes conflicting requirements of executing a primary mission (e.g. search and rescue) while maintaining a robust mobile wireless communication network among the swarm members. Three different spatial requirements for robust communication are considered in this project: proximity, line of sight and redundancy. To this end, several artificial potential fields have been developed and simulated to determine their success in controlling the swarm. The strengths and weaknesses, the design process and the interaction of the controllers constitute the heart of the paper. At a higher level, we address the challenge of how to compose these motion control laws to achieve the primary mission in a meaningful way.  2005 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SSST.2005.1460945</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Tuskegee, AL, United states</custom1><custom3>37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Zhiqiang</author><author>Kumar, Hemanth</author><author>Davari, Asad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance evaluation of OFDM transmission in UAV wireless communication</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the Annual Southeastern Symposium on System Theory</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</full-title></periodical><pages>6-10</pages><volume>37</volume><keywords><keyword>Military operations</keyword><keyword>Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing</keyword><keyword>Unmanned vehicles</keyword><keyword>Wireless telecommunication systems</keyword><keyword>Natural frequencies</keyword><keyword>Local area networks</keyword><keyword>Bit error rate</keyword><keyword>Communication channels (information theory)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SSST.2005.1460867</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in collaborative missions is an increasing research area for military planners. One of the important factors to ensure the collaboration among swarm UAVs is the reliable, high performance wireless communication links among UAVs. Because of its high frequency efficiency and high performance, OFDM based multi-carrier transmission technology has been considered one of the strong candidates for swarm UAV communications. However, UAV communication links are quite different from Wireless LAN and Wireless MAN environments where OFDM is currently used. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the BER performance of IEEE 802.11a compatible OFDM system in a UAV wireless communication channel where a large Doppler shift has been observed and where Inter-Carrier-Interference (ICI) is much larger than those of Wireless LAN and Wireless MAN scenarios.  2005 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SSST.2005.1460867</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Tuskegee, AL, United states</custom1><custom3>37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Masehian, Ellips</author><author>Royan, Mitra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new model for solving the simultaneous object collecting and shepherding problem in flocking robots</title><tertiary-title>IJCCI 2012 - Proceedings of the 4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, IJCCI 2012, October 5, 2012 - October 7, 2012</full-title></periodical><pages>96-105</pages><keywords><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Fuzzy inference</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>SciTePress</publisher><abstract>Shepherding behavior is a class of collective behaviors in flocking systems which requires that a swarm of mobile robots enter an area populated with known or unknown obstacles, collect a flock of static or dynamic particles (objects), and guide them safely to a predefined goal position. Applications of this behavior are in sheep or duck shepherding and fishing. In this paper, a new algorithmic model is developed for online formation control, decision making, behavior selection, and motion planning of a team of homogeneous and anonymous (no leader and follower) flocking robots which simultaneously perform object collecting and shepherding tasks. The model's architecture is enriched with various complex flocking actions such as flock deformation, flock split and merge, flock expansion, and flock obstacle avoidance. Contributions of this paper include (i) defining a new class of problems for flocking robots called Simultaneous Object Collecting and Shepherding (SOCS) problem, (ii) incorporating online obstacle sensing and avoidance methods in the flocking behavior, and (iii) developing a fuzzy expert system for determining the strategy of environment exploration. The fuzzy inference engine provides an effective way to minimize the time spent on collecting objects while maximizing the gain obtained by object collection, in a way that the flock's formation and integrity is maintained. The proposed model was implemented on a number of simulations and produced rational and satisfactory results.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, IJCCI 2012, October 5, 2012 - October 7, 2012&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, IJCCI 2012, October 5, 2012 - October 7, 2012</research-notes><custom1>Barcelona, Spain</custom1><custom3>4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, IJCCI 2012, October 5, 2012 - October 7, 2012</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shim, Sangwoo</author><author>Kim, Taehun</author><author>Hyun, Soon J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control Integrated Query Processing System for Coordination of Multiple UAVs</title><secondary-title>14th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2017 14TH IEEE ANNUAL CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS &amp; NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)</full-title></periodical><pages>528-533</pages><keywords><keyword>Multi-UAV system</keyword><keyword>Automation system</keyword><keyword>Query Processor</keyword><keyword>Testbed implemenation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-5090-6196-9</isbn><abstract>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining more popularity thanks to their versatility, miniaturization, and inexpensiveness. Beyond the limits of single UAV system, multi-UAV systems which can perform complex mission-oriented tasks better have been recently introduced. However, previous systems are less automated in the way that human intervention is still required to execute missions, and they were implemented for the only purpose of carrying out specific scenarios. In this paper, in order to automate the required procedures in the system and increase system flexibility, we propose a control integrated query processing system for coordination of multiple UAVs. We devise a high level query language to express a user command for a variety of UAVs' tasks by integrating the ways of controlling movements and actions of multiple UAVs and collecting data from them. We present the overall architecture of the query processing system and experimental results on testbed using real UAVs.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 14TH IEEE ANNUAL CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS &amp; NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 14TH IEEE ANNUAL CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS &amp; NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2017 14TH IEEE ANNUAL CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS &amp; NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Lizhi</author><author>Zhao, Xuejiao</author><author>Zhang, Yuan</author><author>Wang, Xiaohong</author><author>Ma, Tielin</author><author>Gao, Xia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unmanned aerial vehicle swarm mission reliability modeling and evaluation method oriented to systematic and networked mission</title><secondary-title>CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS</full-title><abbr-1>Chin.

Traditional single-UAV mission reliability modeling methods have been unable to meet the requirements of UAV swarm mission reliability modeling. Therefore, the UAV swarm mission reliability modeling and evaluation method is proposed. First, aimed at the interdependence among the multiple layers, a multi-layer network model of a UAV swarm is established. At the same time, based on the system having the following characteristics?using a mission chain to complete the mission and applying the connectivity of the mission network?the mission network model of a UAV swarm is established. Second, vulnerability and connectivity are selected as two indicators to reflect the reliability of the mission, and aimed at random attack and deliberate attack, vulnerability and connectivity evaluation methods are proposed. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the constructed model are verified through simulations,and the model and selected indicators can meet the reliability requirements of the UAV swarm mis-sion. In this way, this study provides quantitative reference for UAV-swarm-related decision -making work and supports the development of UAV-swarm-related work.

The variations in UAV distances from each other, considering their individual trajectories, and the medium dynamic factors are important points to be addressed.In this context, to increase the stability of UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication with link quality, this paper presents an interface manager (IM) that is capable of improving communication in multi-UAV networks.Given a predefined set of available individual wireless interfaces, the proposed IM dynamically defines the best interface for sending messages based on on-flight conditions sensed and calculated dynamically from the wireless medium. Different simulation scenarios are generated using a complex and realistic experimental setup composed of traditional simulators such as NS-3, Gazebo, and GzUAV. IEEE 802.11n 2.4 GHz and 802.11p 5 GHz interfaces are used for the IM selection. The IM performance is evaluated in terms of metrics from the medium-access-control (MAC) and physical layers, which aim to improve and maintain the connectivity between the UAVs during the mission, and from the application layer, which targets the reliability in the delivery of messages. The obtained results show that compared with the cases where a single interface is used, the proposed IM is able to increase the network throughput and presents the best proportion of transmitted and received packets, reception power (-60 dBm to -75 dBm), and loss (-80 dB to -85 dB), resulting in a more efficient and stable network connections.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://49779/Ribeiro et al. - 2021 - Communication Interface Manager for Improving Perf.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shah, A.

Multi-UAV systems structured in an ad hoc manner called UAVs ad hoc network which is also familiar as flying ad hoc Network (FANET). For FANETs, the IEEE 802.11 standard offers Medium Access Control (MAC) layer requirements. Optimization of the contention window (CW) size will optimize the output. Three distinct meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are used in this paper to improve the efficiency of FANETs, which are the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CUCO), the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) \ and the Honey Bee Algorithm (HBA). Optimum CW size is defined through meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Performance comparison among CUCO, DEA, HBA, and traditional MAC based on IEEE 802.11 is presented. Relationships among parameters are obtained through Markov chain based analytical study. Performance metrics such as successful transmission probability, collision probability, channel busy probability, throughput, packet dropping rate (PDR), and delay expressions are derived. Simulation results reveal that meta-heuristic optimization algorithms improve the quality and reliability of communication by increasing throughput and decreasing PDR and latency.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Bo</author><author>Hu, Chaofang</author><author>Zhou, Yimin</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Fu, M.</author><author>Sun, J.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>The Ground Station Design for Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Control</title><secondary-title>38th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 38TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE (CCC)</full-title></periodical><pages>8248-8253</pages><keywords><keyword>Software</keyword><keyword>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</keyword><keyword>Communication Protocol</keyword><keyword>Ground Station Control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-988-15639-7-2</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.23919/chicc.2019.8865734</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the development of Science and technology and reform in military field, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays more and more key role in the current world. Along with the fast exploration of UAVs, the ground control station (GCS) as the link between people and UAVs is particularly important. In this paper, the UAV based GCS is studied and programmed for software achievement. The involved technologies include multi-thread mechanism, Windows message transmission mechanism and serial port communication technology. AS for the GCS, it can be divided into Main frame interface, link communication, control instruction and map navigation such modules. After the basic function achievement of the GCS. the simulation tests and practical experiments are performed to verify the control performance. Experimental results can demonstrate that the GCS can send the remote control commands to the UAVs accurately in real-time.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 38TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE (CCC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 38TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE (CCC)</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>PROCEEDINGS OF THE 38TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE (CCC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Qin</author><author>Parasuraman, Ramviyas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hierarchical Needs Based Self-Adaptive Framework For Cooperative Multi-Robot System</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)</full-title></periodical><pages>2991-2998</pages><keywords><keyword>ARCHITECTURE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72818-526-2</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/smc42975.2020.9283249</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research in multi-robot and swarm systems has seen significant interest in cooperation of agents in complex and dynamic environments. To effectively adapt to unknown environments and maximize the utility of the group, robots need to cooperate, share information, and make a suitable plan according to the specific scenario. Inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of human needs and systems theory, we introduce Robot's Need Hierarchy and propose a new solution called Self-Adaptive Swarm System (SASS). It combines multi-robot perception, communication, planning, and execution with the cooperative management of conflicts through a distributed Negotiation-Agreement Mechanism that prioritizes robot's needs. We also decompose the complex tasks into simple executable behaviors through several Atomic Operations, such as selection, formation, and routing. We evaluate SASS through simulating static and dynamic tasks and comparing them with the state-of-the-art collision-aware task assignment method integrated into our framework.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)&#xD;&#xD;The

opportunities for a novel class of highly interactive, attention-sharing human-machine teams. Reliable, lightweight, yet passive exchange of intent, data and inferences within such human-machine teams make them suitable for scenarios such as search-and-rescue with significantly improved performance in terms of speed, accuracy and semantic awareness. In this paper, we articulate a vision for such human-drone teams and key technical capabilities such teams must encompass. We present TagTeam, an early prototype of such a team and share promising demonstration of a key capability (i.e., motion awareness).</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no
