Aiming to solve the multi-task reconnaissance planning by multi-UAV, a novel distributed task planning method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a distributed contract network protocol is proposed to achieve task allocation for multi-UAV. Comparing with traditional method, the communication load is reduced and the allocation speed is improved. Afterwards, an improved PSO path planning is carried out to provide a feasible flying path to the target. The planning efficiency is increased via introducing chaotic map initialization and adaptive parameter adjustment. Finally, numerical simulations for multi-task reconnaissance mission are given. The results show the quick generation of task execution sequence and reconnaissance paths, and are also consistent with reconnaissance engineering applications.  2022, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-8155-7_178</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Tianjin, China</custom1><custom3>International Conference on Guidance, Navigation and Control, ICGNC 2020, October 23, 2020  -  October 25, 2020</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Shuai</author><author>Bai, Yuebin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-UAV Joint Observation, Communication, and Policy in MEC</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings - 2022 18th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking, MSN 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>18th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking, MSN 2022, December 14, 2022  -  December 16, 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>891-896</pages><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Deep learning</keyword><keyword>Computation offloading</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Energy utilization</keyword><keyword>Learning systems</keyword><keyword>Fertilizers</keyword><keyword>Mobile edge computing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/MSN57253.2022.00144</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The use of multi-agent reinforcement learning methods (MARL) in mobile edge computing (MEC) environments enables multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) to intelligently provide relay or computational offloading services to mission targets. UAV's observation range and communication methods between UAVs have a significant impact on multi-UAV collaboration strategy. For this purpose, we study the multi-UAV observation range dynamic control method and the optimal inter-UAV communication method. Our approach is to design a multi-UAV joint observation, communication, policy, and service collaboration protocol and study the optimization method of the protocol. We propose an expert-guided deep reinforcement learning framework to optimize this protocol. Each UAV's optimal radar observation range and inter-UAV communication method are learned using an information entropy value decomposition method. Through our observation and communication method, multi-UAV are able to obtain the most valuable information. Experiments demonstrate that our method can improve MEC's service coverage by 9.38%-21.88% compared to the classical MARL algorithm. Our method improves the radar observation efficiency and communication efficiency by 3.05%-38.9% and 8.55%-22.03%, respectively. The results show that this method improves multi-UAV energy utilization.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSN57253.2022.00144</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Virtual, Online, China</custom1><custom3>18th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking, MSN 2022, December 14, 2022  -  December 16, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Zhekun</author><author>Zhao, Liangyu</author><author>Shi, Zhongjiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decentralized Multi-UAV Path Planning Based on Two-Layer Coordinative Framework for Formation Rendezvous</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>45695-45708</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Energy utilization</keyword><keyword>Numerical methods</keyword><keyword>Convex optimization</keyword><keyword>Optimal control systems</keyword><keyword>Scalability</keyword><keyword>Computational efficiency</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>21693536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3170583</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation rendezvous path planning problem is one of the important research topics in multiple UAV (multi-UAV) coordinated path planning. Aiming at solving low computational efficiency and poor scalability of the traditional multi-UAV path planning method, the decentralized multi-UAV path planning method suitable for obstacle environments is proposed. Firstly, the UAV rendezvous path planning problem with constraints such as the kinematics of UAVs and collision-free constraints is modeled as a non-convex optimal control problem. To minimize formation rendezvous time and energy consumption, a two-layer coordinative framework is developed to solve this problem. In the coordination layer, relying only on the information of neighboring UAVs, each UAV in the decentralized communication graph negotiates the desired flight time using a consensus protocol to achieve coordination among UAVs. In the planning layer, the initial non-convex formation rendezvous path planning problem is decoupled into several sub-problems, which can be solved in parallel by path planners distributed on each UAV using sequential convex programming. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results show that this decentralized multi-UAV path planning method can handle the minimum-time rendezvous path planning problem and optimize the energy consumption in flight, and the computing time does not increase significantly with the enlargement of the UAV swarm. This decentralized framework scales well with the number of UAVs and can be applied for future urban flight and supplies delivery tasks.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3170583</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goricanec, Jurica</author><author>Ivanovic, Antun</author><author>Markovic, Lovro</author><author>Pavlak, Ivan</author><author>Bogdan, Stjepan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Civil infrastructure data acquisition in urban environments based on multi-UAV mission</title><tertiary-title>2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2021</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2021, June 15, 2021  -  June 18, 2021</full-title></periodical><pages>542-551</pages><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Data acquisition</keyword><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476735</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Increased capabilities of modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in terms of autonomy and payload operations lead towards development of multi-agent UAV systems. While the multi-UAV systems have a great potential in many different scenarios, increasing complexity of missions gave raise to a new set of problems. Some of them include high workload periods of a single operator supervising multiple agents, loss of the situation awareness, increased amount of the data generated by the system and problems in communication channels between the operator and UAVs. All of them could lead to performance degradation in the mission execution or even critical failures of system elements. In general, there are two aspects that help to avoid or at least to decrease mentioned problems - mission planning and human-machine interface (HMI) design. In this paper, we mainly address the mission planning aspect and only briefly present an HMI design that allows simultaneous handling of three UAVs in civil infrastructure data acquisition missions. The proposed interface, among the standard telemetry data, includes data download/upload from/to external services, a trajectory planner and the acquired data representation. The proposed architecture has been tested in a simulation and in a real environment.  2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476735</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Athens, Greece</custom1><custom3>2021 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2021, June 15, 2021  -  June 18, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singhal, Chetna</author><author>Barick, Subhrajit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECMS: Energy-Efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance System for Inaccessible Regions</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>95876-95891</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Monitoring</keyword><keyword>Digital storage</keyword><keyword>Energy efficiency</keyword><keyword>Security systems</keyword><keyword>Network topology</keyword><keyword>Traffic congestion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>21693536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206375</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The evolution and popular adaptation of drone technology in diverse applications has necessitated advancement of UAV communication framework. UAVs inherently support features like mobility, flexibility, adaptive altitude, which make them a preferable option for dynamic surveillance of remote locations. Multiple UAVs can cooperatively work to accomplish surveillance missions more efficiently. However, the intermittent network connectivity and the limited onboard energy storage impose a great challenge on UAV-assisted remote surveillance. This paper presents an Energy-efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance (ECMS) system for surveillance of inaccessible regions. The system employs an optimal Multi-UAV Collaborative Monocular Vision (MCMV) topology to facilitate the surveillance with zero blind spot using minimum number of drones. We also propose an application-aware Multi-Path Weighted Load-balancing (MWL) routing protocol for handling congestion by distributing traffic among all available resources in UAV network and adaptively selecting the of source datarate (i.e. switching video resolution). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed surveillance system achieves coverage with lesser number of UAVs compared to the existing systems. It also achieves higher throughput, higher packet-delivery ratio, higher residual energy of UAVs, and lower end-to-end delay.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206375</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bayerlein, Harald</author><author>Theile, Mirco</author><author>Caccamo, Marco</author><author>Gesbert, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-UAV Path Planning for Wireless Data Harvesting with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><secondary-title>IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1171-1187</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Data acquisition</keyword><keyword>Deep learning</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Internet of things</keyword><keyword>Learning systems</keyword><keyword>Fertilizers</keyword><keyword>Markov processes</keyword><keyword>Sensor nodes</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword><keyword>Harvesting</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2644125X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3081996</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Harvesting data from distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices with multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging problem requiring flexible path planning methods. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.  2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3081996</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, Le-Mai-Duyen</author><author>Vo, Van Nhan</author><author>So-In, Chakchai</author><author>Dang, Viet-Hung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Throughput analysis and optimization for NOMA Multi-UAV assisted disaster communication using CMA-ES</title><secondary-title>Wireless Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wireless Networks</full-title><abbr-1>Wireless Networks</abbr-1></periodical><pages>4889-4902</pages><volume>27</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Internet of things</keyword><keyword>Evolutionary algorithms</keyword><keyword>Disasters</keyword><keyword>Sensor nodes</keyword><keyword>Channel state information</keyword><keyword>Base stations</keyword><keyword>Covariance matrix</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10220038</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11276-021-02771-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>When communication infrastructure is destroyed by natural disasters, reconstructing a flexible network for search and rescue or restoring transmission channels is a necessary mission. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the system performance for the Internet of Things (IoT) using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the disaster area. The communication protocol is separated into two phases: In the first phase, due to the resource limitation, UAV relays (URs) harvest energy from a ground power beacon (GPB) to support the communication process. In the second phase, the ground base station (GBS) sends the signal to the first UR by using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. It is noted that the first UR uses its energy harvested from the first phase to forward the signal to the second UR by applying the decode-and-forward (DF) approach. Similarly, the second UR uses DF to transfer the signal to two IoT sensor node (IoTS) clusters, i.e., near cluster and far cluster. Accordingly, we derive the closed-form expression of the throughput for the IoTSs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) with Nakagami-m fading and formulate a new problem of throughput optimization for multi-UAV system. For optimization problem, solutions are found using covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. The numerical results show that system performance in terms of throughput can be improved by tuning the UAVs altitudes and distances from the GBS to suitable values.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11276-021-02771-3</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vlasceanu, Emilian</author><author>Popescu, Dan</author><author>Ichim, Loretta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-Uav Architecture for Ground Data Collection</title><tertiary-title>International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>39th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2019, July 28, 2019  -  August 2, 2019</full-title></periodical><pages>9192-9195</pages><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Data acquisition</keyword><keyword>Rock mechanics</keyword><keyword>Internet of things</keyword><keyword>Data transfer</keyword><keyword>Wireless sensor networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898909</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The paper presents a unmanned aerial system (UAS), based on a multi-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) architecture, integrated in Internet, able to collect data from ground wireless sensor networks (WSNs), deployed on large areas.

Maritime target positioning is very important for the safe navigation of ships, hydrographic surveys, and marine resource exploration. Traditional methods typically exploit satellites to locate marine targets in the SAGIN environment, and the location accuracy does not satisfy the requirements of modern ocean observation missions. In order to localize the marine target, we develop a system architecture in this article, which contains UAVs integrated with monostatic multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars. The main thrust is to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) via MIMO radar. Herein, we consider a general scenario that unknown mutual coupling exist and a novel sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is adopted with the help of its special structure, we formulate the data model as a sparse representation form. Then, two novel matrices, a weighted matrix, and a reduced-dimensional matrix are constructed to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the sparsity, respectively. Thereafter, a sparse constraint model is constructed using the concept of optimal weighted subspace fitting (WSF). Finally, the DOA estimation of maritime targets can be achieved by reconstructing the support of a block sparse matrix. Based on the DOA estimation results, multiple UAVs are used to cross-locate marine targets multiple times, and an accurate marine target position is achieved in the SAGIN environment. Numerical results are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimator, and the multi-UAV cooperative localization system can realize accurate target localization.  2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3066504</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bouachir, Ouns</author><author>Aloqaily, Moayad</author><author>Garcia, Fabien</author><author>Larrieu, Nicolas</author><author>Gayraud, Thierry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Testbed of QoS Ad-Hoc network designed for cooperative multi-drone tasks</title><tertiary-title>MobiWac 2019 - Proceedings of the 17th ACM International Symposium on Mobility Management and Wireless Access</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>17th ACM International Symposium on Mobility Management and Wireless Access, MobiWac 2019, November 25, 2019  -  November 29, 2019</full-title></periodical><pages>89-95</pages><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Deep learning</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword><keyword>Vehicle to vehicle communications</keyword><keyword>Environmental technology</keyword><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Testbeds</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Association for Computing Machinery</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/3345770.3356740</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Thanks to technological advances in information and communications, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (aka drones) technology has become one of the most important service delivery inventions these days. Equipped with sensors and cameras, these technologies can perform much on-demand critical application ranging from military and environmental to rescue operations. These UAVs devices, sometimes tiny, that can replace human and manned aircraft in several tasks, have been utilized to perform various types of services and applications more efficiently. However, the deployment side of such emerging technology is still facing many issues and challenges. Using multi-drones or swarm of drones, together to accomplish one operation is one of these recent challenges. Such a system requires a high level of delicacy and cooperation to achieve the required autonomy and reduce human interaction as possible. Communication is one of the biggest challenges in these systems, since the devices should keep exchanging various types of messages with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, a collaborative autonomous system of swarm drones based on deep learning has been proposed and a testbed of cooperative UAVs' mission to validate the performance of the dedicated QoS communication system using Paparazzi drones The proposed system is aware of the drones' requirements in term of QoS and able to meet with their dynamic demands.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3345770.3356740</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Miami Beach, FL, United states</custom1><custom3>17th ACM International Symposium on Mobility Management and Wireless Access, MobiWac 2019, November 25, 2019  -  November 29, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Shengnan</author><author>Guo, Xiaoye</author><author>Xu, Fengchi</author><author>Wang, Zishuai</author><author>Xie, Yangliu</author><author>Wu, Yulun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Research on Modeling of USV Swarm Target Defense Mission System from DoDAF Operational Viewpoint</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of 2021 IEEE International Conference on Unmanned Systems, ICUS 2021</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2021 IEEE International Conference on Unmanned Systems, ICUS 2021, October 15, 2021  -  October 17, 2021</full-title></periodical><pages>214-218</pages><keywords><keyword>Architecture</keyword><keyword>Network security</keyword><keyword>Modeling languages</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICUS52573.2021.9641379</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The process of USV swarm target defense mission is described based on OODA (Observation, Orientation, Decision and Action) ring, and the architecture model of USV swarm target defense mission is studied according to DoDAF (Department of Defense Architecture Framework) operational viewpoint and modeling language SysML.

Moreover, since UAV's energy constrained, it will be a good measure to take multiple UAVs to collect data from devices in large areas. In this paper, we investigate multi-UAV collaborative data collection system, where multiple UAVs collect data from two-dimensional distributed devices on flying mode or hovering mode. The objective is to minimize UAVs' total flight time while allowing each device to complete data upload successfully with limited energy. To this end, firstly, a cell partition based on Voronoi diagram is used to allocate the collection areas of each UAV. Then, in each associated area, UAV determines the whole trajectory to serve devices. Lastly, given load requirement of ground devices and energy limitation, the optimal data collection mode of each device is decided to minimize flight time of each UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-UAV data collection scheme can shorten collection task completion time significantly.  2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120646</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Seoul, Korea, Republic of</custom1><custom3>2020 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC 2020, May 25, 2020  -  May 28, 2020</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Hao</author><author>Carrillo, L.R.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fast reinforcement learning based distributed optimal flocking control and network co-design for uncertain networked multi-UAV system</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017  -  April 13, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)</pages><volume>10195</volume><keywords><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Military applications</keyword><keyword>Aircraft control</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Distributed computer systems</keyword><keyword>Networked control systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>SPIE</publisher><isbn>0277786X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.2262877</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Military applications require networked multi-UAV system to perform practically, optimally and reliably under changing mission requirements. Lacking the effective control and communication algorithms is impeding the development of multi-UAV systems significantly. In this paper, distributed optimal flocking control and network co-design problem has been investigated for networked multi-UAV system in presence of uncertain harsh environment and unknown dynamics. First, the mathematical interaction between network imperfections and practical wireless network channel performance has been investigate. Then, a novel co-model has been developed for networked multi-UAV combining effects from physical system and network channel model effectively. Then, adopting neuro dynamics programming (NDP) technique and actor-critic-identifier (ACI) design architecture, a novel online finite horizon optimal flocking control and network co-design has been proposed. The developed algorithm cannot merely obtain the distributed optimal co-design within finite time, but also relax the stringent requirement about physical UAV system and network dynamics. In addition, developed novel co-design can satisfy the practical constraints, e.g. transmit power constraint etc. The Lyapunov stability analysis is used to validate the effectiveness of developed scheme. With the proper NN weight update law, proposed co-design can ensure all closed-loop signals and NN weights are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Furthermore, simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme.  2017 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2262877</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Anaheim, CA, United states</custom1><custom3>Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017  -  April 13, 2017</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aljehani, Maher</author><author>Inoue, Masahiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication and autonomous control of multi-UAV system in disaster response tasks</title><tertiary-title>Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>11th KES International Conference on Agent and Multi-Agent Systems—Technologies and Applications, KES-AMSTA 2017, June 21, 2017 - June 23, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>123-132</pages><volume>74</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Aircraft detection</keyword><keyword>Rock mechanics</keyword><keyword>Aircraft control</keyword><keyword>Internet of things</keyword><keyword>Transmission control protocol</keyword><keyword>Aerial photography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH</publisher><isbn>21903018</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-59394-4_12</electronic-resource-num><abstract>After disasters occurrence, advanced technologies always play significant contributions to various disaster response tasks. For instance, utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for aerial imagery data helps to get a real-time monitoring system of the stricken areas. Recently, UAV is becoming a ubiquitous system and valuable technology in many civil applications, motivating researchers to endeavor to develop UAVs systems. Moreover, Internet of Things (IoT) has been employed to several study cases of disaster response. Using IoT to communicate, manage and control multiple UAVs after disaster occurrence is a real practical approach. However, this kind of integration wasnt clearly presented especially in the technical sides like communication and autonomous control. Consequently, this paper aims to reveal the scientific scenes of communications and controls between multiple UAVs and Ground Control Stations (GCSs). Due to an unexpected failure within a single UAV system, this study presents a multi-UAV system for scanning and tracking missions. Authors turned UAV to an IoT device by using embedded LTE dongle on the UAV control board. In the beginning of the paper, authors raised the issues of existing systems. Then, presented the design and process of the proposed system. Lastly, they demonstrated some results through experiments.

Advances in distributed systems, miniaturization and commoditization of space electronics and innovations in communications permit us to rethink the current paradigm of relying on a few heavy, slow and expensive high-tech rovers for Mars surface exploration. In this work, we address the demanding communication needs for a mission that deploys a swarm of uncontrolled wind-driven exploration rovers onto the martian surface. The concept for these lightweight, autonomous, ellipsoid"Tumbleweed" rovers - named after the desert plant - is not new, and was studied and validated by NASA researchers decades ago. Recently, a new plan to turn the Tumbleweed mission into reality has been proposed to the ESA open space innovation platform (OSIP). The idea is to launch approximately 90 Tumbleweeds in one transfer vehicle and release them on the martian surface to survey the northern hemisphere of Mars over a mission duration of three months. Reliable communication is one of the key challenges for this mission. The rovers' instruments, e.g. cameras, generate large volumes of data, and many rovers need to be served simultaneously. Furthermore, the tumbling motion on the martian surface constitutes unprecedented challenges in terms of antenna pointing for planetary exploration rovers. We present a trade-off analysis between direct to Earth communication and relayed communication using satellites orbiting Mars culminating in a baseline communication architecture for the Tumbleweed mission. For this purpose we model the kinematics of the Tumbleweed rovers and relay satellites w.r.t the Earth. A numerical simulation of all potential communication links over the full mission duration is conducted. The analysis shows that direct communication to Earth is infeasible due to the rolling motion of the rover. Hence, the relayed communication scenario is proposed, as it does not require a directional antenna on the Tumbleweed rovers. Therefore, we propose a constellation of three relay satellites in a circular, Earth-facing orbital plane around Mars, which communicate with the Tumbleweed rovers using the UHF frequency band. Commercial ground stations on Earth in Ka-band are used for the relay-ground link. The proposed communications architecture is estimated to achieve a raw data throughput of 84Mbit per Tumbleweed rover per Sol. Copyright  2022 by Mr. Felix Abel.

Based on the concept of modularity, the proposed architecture divides the overall system into five layers: 1) low-level control layer; 2) high-level control layer; 3) coordination layer; 4) communication layer; and 5) human interaction layer, and many modules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and outputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can be reduced but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale of 21 fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work which successfully demonstrates formation flight, target recognition, and tracking missions within an integrated architecture for fixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2020.3033935</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Yuman</author><author>Wang, Yingjian</author><author>Zhong, Xingguang</author><author>Yang, Tiankai</author><author>Wang, Mingyang</author><author>Xu, Zhixiong</author><author>Wang, Yongchao</author><author>Lin, Yi</author><author>Xu, Chao</author><author>Gao, Fei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meeting-Merging-Mission: A Multi-robot Coordinate Framework for Large-Scale Communication-Limited Exploration</title><tertiary-title>IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS 2022, October 23, 2022  -  October 27, 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>13700-13707</pages><volume>2022-October</volume><keywords><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword><keyword>Industrial robots</keyword><keyword>Multipurpose robots</keyword><keyword>Bandwidth</keyword><keyword>Merging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><isbn>21530858</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981544</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This letter presents a complete framework Meeting-Merging-Mission for multi-robot exploration under communication restriction. Considering communication is limited in both bandwidth and range in the real world, we propose a lightweight environment presentation method and an efficient cooperative exploration strategy. For lower bandwidth, each robot uses specific polytopes to maintain free space and to generate Super Frontier Information (SFI), which serves as the source for exploration decision-making. To reduce repeated exploration, we develop a mission-based protocol that drives robots to share collected information in stable rendezvous. We also design a complete path planning scheme for both centralized and decentralized cases. To validate that our framework is practical and generic, we present an extensive benchmark and deploy our system into multi-UGV and multi-UAV platforms.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981544</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Kyoto, Japan</custom1><custom3>2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS 2022, October 23, 2022  -  October 27, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, Chandra Has</author><author>Mishra, Vishal</author><author>Jain, Kamal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Review of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle Swarm System Coordination and Communication</title><tertiary-title>Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Virtual International Conference on Soft Computing, Optimization Theory and Applications, SCOTA 2021, March 26, 2021  -  March 27, 2021</full-title></periodical><pages>485-499</pages><volume>404</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Vehicle to vehicle communications</keyword><keyword>Cell proliferation</keyword><keyword>Disintegration</keyword><keyword>Radio communication</keyword><keyword>Vehicular ad hoc networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer</publisher><isbn>21941009</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-031-19309-5_32</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this modern era, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have effectively changed and transformed the aeronautical industry in an effective way. A specific technique created to increase this disintegration is the UAV swarm system. The UAV swarm has the ability to deliver missions effectively and self-coordinate the operations of multiple UAVs with no remote operator intervening. This paper comprehensively surveys the literature about various UAV swarm functioning. It proposes a swarm architecture considering the high parameters that allow wireless radio communication infrastructure for a high degree of swarm system reliability and autonomy. This review paper chronicle did preliminary test development to carry out this proposed swarm wireless radio communication system architecture. UAVs gradual integrated development of UAV swarms with UAV communications Autonomous self-coordination and organizing capability are central to advancing the utility of UAV swarm systems. Several limiting factors hamper the usability of UAVs and reduce performance, including communication, various networking challenges, size-load, and proper power considerations. In addition, the wireless radio system takes advantage of a highly reliable and robust infrastructure for wireless radio communications with secure one machine to another machine.  2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-19309-5_32</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Virtual, Online</custom1><custom3>Virtual International Conference on Soft Computing, Optimization Theory and Applications, SCOTA 2021, March 26, 2021  -  March 27, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kayalvizhi, M.</author><author>Ramamoorthy, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Blockchain-based Secure Data Transmission for UAV Swarm using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization Path Planning Algorithm</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications</full-title><abbr-1>International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications</abbr-1></periodical><pages>554-563</pages><volume>12</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Network security</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Vehicle to vehicle communications</keyword><keyword>Blockchain</keyword><keyword>Sensor nodes</keyword><keyword>Mobile security</keyword><keyword>Base stations</keyword><keyword>Denial-of-service attack</keyword><keyword>Data communication systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2158107X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0121163</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles assisted applications enabled with a communication system, they are open to various malicious attacks. As a new form of flying things, they can access the network for better communication via the aerial base station. Most of the Unmanned aerial vehicles assisted flying objects' optimal path selection schemes does not consider the path deviation. In path deviation attacks, secure data transmission are not addressed in existing works. The secure communication process between Unmanned aerial vehicles and base station are exploited through security-based attacks. Moreover, path loss issue leads to multicast packet loss and unsecured broadcast. The existing network architecture setup does not fulfill the secure data communication and privacy issues. In this paper, Blockchain is utilized to investigate the secure communication between Unmanned aerial vehicles to Wireless Unmanned aerial vehicles Base stations. Since the destination information is dynamic under an uncertain environment, it will cause a delay in data communication. Unmanned aerial vehicles are more vulnerable to security attacks. The proposed blockchain-based architecture supports secure data communication in Unmanned aerial vehicles uncertain environments. To improve network security, this paper designs a modified particle swarm optimization method for better path selection. Through these experimental results, a blockchain-based data communication scheme is outer performed concerning network security.  2021.

The individual optimal particle is selected by using the dominant relationship between the individual particles, and the optimization of the optimal particle is completed by combining the selection requirements of the global optimal particle. We design the v2x communication implementation scheme, obtain the traffic flow information of urban rail transit, build the signal input and output model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm, obtain the output feedback signal, and determine the planning scale of urban rail transit network, so as to build the urban rail transit network planning model and complete the urban rail transit network planning. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the utilization rate of urban rail transit network planning, effectively control the change of network signal amplitude, and reduce the repetition rate of urban rail transit network planning.  2022 Ning Yu.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/2401333</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Ming</author><author>Tang, Hong</author><author>Zhang, Peng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Survey of path planning technologies for robots swarm</title><secondary-title>Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology</full-title><abbr-1>Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>127-138</pages><volume>43</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Biomimetics</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Learning systems</keyword><keyword>Cluster computing</keyword><keyword>Simulation platform</keyword><keyword>Intelligent robots</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword><keyword>Scalability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10012486</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.11887/j.cn.202101017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As an important carrier of group intelligence, robot clusters have also received a lot of research and development and more and more applications.

With the growing size of the UAV swarm in complex missions, it becomes a challenge to control them for efficient execution of missions. In a traditional centralized communication model where all UAVs in the swarm are controlled directly through ground control, channel capacity limits the number of UAVs in the swarm which restricts the scalability. In the context of low-power miniature drones, we limit the communication of the ground Base Station (gBS) with only one UAV (leader) which controls the rest of the UAVs (followers). Towards this, we propose a greedy heuristic method for selecting the UAV leader that requires minimal time to communicate with the gBS in real-time. The proposed master-slave model enhances the scalability of the swarm by improving the utilization of channel resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic leader selection enhances the lifetime of the entire network with a multifold decrease in energy consumption, compared to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the lifetime of the network also decreases on operating with a single UAV leader. We also observe reductions in delays by almost 60% and an increase in data rate by 50%.  2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685538</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Madrid, Spain</custom1><custom3>2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2021, December 7, 2021  -  December 11, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carpentiero, Marco</author><author>Sabatini, Marco</author><author>Palmerini, Giovanni B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication and navigation architecture for planetary exploration carried-on by a swarm of mobile robots</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>69th International Astronautical Congress: #InvolvingEveryone, IAC 2018, October 1, 2018  -  October 5, 2018</full-title></periodical><pages>Boeing; et al.; Landspace; Lockheed Martin; Northrop Grumman; UAE Space Agency</pages><volume>2018-October</volume><keywords><keyword>Software testing</keyword><keyword>Navigation</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>MATLAB</keyword><keyword>Rovers</keyword><keyword>Interplanetary spacecraft</keyword><keyword>Mobile robots</keyword><keyword>Codes (symbols)</keyword><keyword>Biology</keyword><keyword>Mobile agents</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>International Astronautical Federation, IAF</publisher><isbn>00741795</isbn><abstract>Planetary exploration is a milestone of future space programs. Continuous evolution in robotics technologies, including improvement in sensors, in miniaturization, in software engineering allows to focus on the concept of unmanned, autonomous exploration carried on by swarm of mobile robots. As taught by several biology's examples, the cooperation among smaller, simpler agents provide effectiveness and ensures a good return even in case of the loss of some - or several - robots. This cooperation is primarily based on the exchange among the swarm's agents of information including payload data and positioning insight. A simple (to keep expandable platforms and their subsystems at a reasonable level in cost and complexity), yet effective communication and navigation architecture is requested to perform the task. The paper is part of a project aiming to first analyse the requirements for this architecture at the general level, and then investigate possible solutions by means of numerical simulations performed with purposely prepared software codes. Performance clearly depends on the mission environment, and in such a concern swarms composed by rovers, drones or low-altitude flying platforms have to be considered, include peculiar motion constraints and issues. Simulations consider radiofrequency links in different bands, with preliminary modelling of the channels' characteristics. Obstacles and outages, breaking the connections, are modelled. A specific attention is devoted to the navigation, in order to assess the nature and amount of data required to provide either a relative or absolute positioning capability: this information is crucial for referencing the data collected by the payload as well as for the coordinated guidance of the swarm. Being robustness the crucial asset of the swarm concept, the performance in different mission scenarios are evaluated on the basis of both deterministic and non-deterministic failures. Previous hands-on experience gained from studies and experiments devoted to small fleets of rovers operating in terrestrial, hostile environment is an important input for this research. As a result, a software code in MATLAB has been prepared and tested in order to be able, during next step of the project, to simulate in details the behaviour of fleets ranging from 2 to tens of agents operating in different scenarios of interest for planetary exploration. In this software code, the communications behaviour enters by limiting the mutual availability of information to the different agents (outages due to interposed obstacles) or out-of-range relative positioning. Navigation instead comes with the uncertainty in the knowledge of the kinematic state. These missing data affect the guidance computation and indeed limit the effectiveness of the exploration itself.  2018 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

Evolutionary algorithms are a conventional method to solve complex optimization problems with multiple constraints. However, they are time-consuming algorithms which make their implementation difficult. UAV path planning is usually a real-time problem that is needed to solve in limited time steps. Parallelization is one of the most effective methods for reducing the computation time of evolutionary algorithms. In the industrial applications, usually there is a communication platform between devices which can be used for the implementation of the parallelization process. For example, controller area network (CAN) is a protocol used for reliable communication in aerospace systems. Due to the development of this protocol on UAVs and its characteristics, it can be used for parallel optimization of path planning problem. In this paper, an asynchronous distributed multi-master parallel genetic algorithm and a parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm are implemented on CAN bus to improve the speed and performance of the UAV path planning.  2019, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40313-019-00549-9</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paul, Shobuj</author><author>Jana, Shuvrangshu</author><author>Chopra, Onkar</author><author>Ratnoo, Ashwini</author><author>Ghose, Debasish</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication Architecture for Autonomous Aerial Traffic Management</title><tertiary-title>7th IEEE International Conference on Recent Advances and Innovations in Engineering, ICRAIE 2022 - Proceedings</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>7th IEEE International Conference on Recent Advances and Innovations in Engineering, ICRAIE 2022, December 1, 2022  -  December 3, 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>298-303</pages><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Collision avoidance</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICRAIE56454.2022.10054266</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents a multi-agent communication paradigm for autonomous aerial traffic management.

In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid ROS-ROS2 communication architecture for centralised traffic management with the provision of distributed communication for collision avoidance and conflict resolution at intersections. The base station server responsible for traffic management runs on a ROS2 environment, ROS is used for communication with each onboard autopilot, and an intermediate add-on-module interfaces ROS and ROS2 messages. The content of the communication packets between the different nodes is decided based on the design requirements.

Mission-critical applications are becoming a vital category of future IoT applications, and due to the advancements in the 5G, the design of mission-critical application overcome a big hurdle. Mission-critical applications must be reliable, and the output should be known in advance. Therefore, to model such application, architecture is considered the cornerstone. One of the major requirements is the flexibility of the operation and the adaptability to new devices. In this paper, an optimal orchestration mechanism is proposed to automate the processes in a conventional multi-device and multi-task mission-critical architecture for flexible and scalable operations. The central goal of this paper is to threefold; first, to model tasks in such a way to maximize the flexibility in the operation plane. Secondly, to design a strongly correlated pair which has maximum relation and thus the chance to hit the task on the devices will be potentially maximized and also the idle time among operations is minimal. Lastly, to register devices in a network which is optimal for the group of this device in terms of correlation. We propose a multi-layer particle swarm optimization for each of the optimization objectives. Results show that the operation plan is flexible and with scaling up the problem size, the orchestration is still graceful and within the requirements of mission-critical applications. The performance of multi-level particle swarm optimization is compared with conventional single-level particle swarm optimization and it has been learned that the later is not only slower but also less accurate.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942611</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khan, Sara Imran</author><author>Qadir, Zakria</author><author>Munawar, Hafiz Suliman</author><author>Nayak, Soumya Ranjan</author><author>Budati, Anil Kumar</author><author>Verma, K.D.</author><author>Prakash, Deo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>UAVs path planning architecture for effective medical emergency response in future networks</title><secondary-title>Physical Communication</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physical Communication</full-title><abbr-1>Physical Communication</abbr-1></periodical><volume>47</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Genetic algorithms</keyword><keyword>Vehicle routing</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Ant colony optimization</keyword><keyword>Traffic congestion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>18744907</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.phycom.2021.101337</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the advancements of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology for use in different environments, it can be easily substituted for traditional transportation in event of emergencies. In the medical domain, UAV can play a vital role in the fast and efficient delivery of first aid and medical supplies. In the current study, safe and smooth UAV navigation from the initial position to the medical emergency location was achieved with optimal path planning through a proposed algorithm. On the notification of patient about his health condition using GSM band, doctor drone was sent from the nearest hospital facility. To avoid traffic congestion the doctor drone provides medical assistance with minimum computational time and transportation cost. The vehicle routing was carried out through proposed algorithms i.e., capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The comparison between the algorithms was carried out at different vehicle capacities and numbers. The CVRP was found to outperform other algorithms with a runtime of 0.06 sec and cost of 419 at vehicle capacity 10, which is 50% less having the same number of the vehicles but increasing the capacities to 20. The results indicate that the effective path planning method could be applied to provide medical aid in real-time with efficacy.  2021</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phycom.2021.101337</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rothenbuchner, Julian</author><author>Cohen, Lucas</author><author>Abel, Felix</author><author>Buryak, Dimitri</author><author>Cuervo, Kristian</author><author>Kingsnorth, James</author><author>Mikulskyt, On</author><author>Phillips, Austin</author><author>Renoldner, Markus</author><author>Sandrieser, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Tumbleweed Mission: Enabling Novel Mars Data Sets through Low-Cost Rover Swarms</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>73rd International Astronautical Congress, IAC 2022, September 18, 2022  -  September 22, 2022</full-title></periodical><volume>2022-September</volume><keywords><keyword>Climate models</keyword><keyword>Rovers</keyword><keyword>Cost reduction</keyword><keyword>Martian surface analysis</keyword><keyword>Nondestructive examination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>International Astronautical Federation, IAF</publisher><isbn>00741795</isbn><abstract>Current Mars surface exploration is characterized by large, infrequent, risky and relatively high-cost space missions that gather in-depth data on a small area. In order to reach the ambitious Mars exploration objectives set out for the coming decades, a significant reduction of cost, risk and schedule is needed. Additionally, many current science objectives, such as improving models of Martian weather and climate as well as internal structure, require long-term surface data over large areas of Mars. We propose a mission architecture based on a swarm of wind-driven rovers that can provide these types of observations, while also reducing high mission cost and risk for Martian exploration. Following mid-air deployment, the rovers unfold and touch down on the surface, roll across the surface until a desired spread of the rovers is achieved, and are then stopped. Scientific data is collected both on-the-roll and when stationary. The Tumbleweed mission provides a unique opportunity to characterize Mars using data over various spatial and temporal scales. We show that a Tumbleweed mission has high utility with respect to Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) Goal II (Climate on Mars) by providing environmental data including temperature, pressure and wind velocity. Goal III (Martian Geology) is addressed by providing highly precise geodetic data and assisting in gravimetric measurements. Moreover, Goal IV (Human Exploration) is fulfilled by surveying large surfaces of Mars, adding crucial context to the current understanding of the Martian environment. With a sensor package consisting of a radio beacon, laser retro-reflector, atmospheric sensors and a rudimentary camera the Tumbleweed mission can address objectives relating to all three aforementioned high-level MEPAG goals. While many aspects of the mission can rely on already-proven technology, further development is needed on a miniaturized location determination system, the folding mechanics of the rover structure, and the rover's power systems. To gain further insight, a half-scale demonstrator of the rover has been constructed and tested in a Mars analogous environment. The results of the test show the general feasibility of the rover and have provided validation of visual instruments. Moreover, a novel reversible, non-destructive method for arresting the rover through reefing sails has been demonstrated. Visual data can be used to further develop a locating algorithm. Another avenue for future research is the communication with the swarm of rolling rovers on the surface of Mars which warrants unique communication strategies.

After analyzing typical features of task cooperation, a hierarchical architecture of task models is firstly proposed and established, where mission, sub-mission and atom task models are designed, from the top-level to the bottom. Meanwhile, a policy-based parsing mechanism is proposed to autonomously decompose a mission into a set of atom tasks with special constraints. On this basis, resource related entities for various atom tasks are designed uniformly, and for the purpose of behavior synchronization, the concept of virtual logic task is further introduced and Topic-based communication channel is adopted over DDS middleware.

The nonlinear dynamic system bifurcation theory together with artificial potential field (APF) method is applied. Artificial control force field is designed so that the system has desired bifurcation and stability characteristics to achieve different formation configurations or formation reconfiguration. Static bifurcating artificial potential fields is designed by using hyperbolic-exponential function to accomplish different static formations. The stability of the formation is verified through theoretical proof using Lyapunov method and local linearization method. In addition, the linear coordinate transformation and redefining of the relative position vector are introduced to generate nonspherically symmetrical potential field so as to realize formation distortion and some non-uniform formations. Different cases of formation flying of swarm with 30 spacecraft are simulated. Numerical results show that the proposed method can achieve many different formation configurations, such as single circle and ellipse, double concentric circle and ellipse, disc elliptical disc, diamond and etc. Each spacecraft moves cooperatively with all the other spacecraft "naturally", without direct communication between each other and any extra external orders or centralized planning and control.

As a result, WSNs have been implemented to monitor animal care and track their health status. However, excessive energy utilization and communication traffic on packet transmissions lead to system deterioration, especially whenever perceived information captured in the monitoring area is transferred to the access point over multiple dynamic sinks. Further to manage the energy and data transmission issue, the energy consumption and location aware routing protocol has been architected on the wireless Nano sensor nodes. In this article, a novel hybrid energy and location aware routing protocol to cloud enabled IoT based Wireless Sensor Network towards animal health monitoring and tracking has been proposed. However proposed data routing protocol incorporates the trace file for path selection for data transmission to base station using sink node. Trace file has been obtained on processing the cluster heads established in the network. Therefore, clustering of node in the network has to be achieved using LEACH protocol which enhances the network scalability and network lifetime by clustering the nodes with Metaheuristics constraints like location or node density comparability. The objective of the proposed model is to enhance the network scalability and energy consumption by establishing the multiple node clusters with high density cluster head through Metaheuristics Node Clustering optimization techniques. Metaheuristics based node clustering is been obtained using Improved Particle Swarm Optimization. Further it is employed to compute the optimal path for sensed data transmission to base station. Node clustering provides high energy consumption among the sensing nodes and to establish the high energy clusters towards sensed information dissemination to base station on dynamically reforming the nodes clusters with respect to Node density and node location. Simulation analysis of the proposed energy efficient routing protocol provides high performance in energy utilization, packet delivery ratio, packet loss and Average delay compared against the conventional protocols on propagation of the data through sink node to base station  2022 SCPE</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.12694/scpe.v23i4.2040</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, Saksham</author><author>Menezes, Naman Antony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi Robot Path Planning Using Priority Based Algorithm</title><tertiary-title>2022 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies, CONECCT 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2022 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies, CONECCT 2022, July 8, 2022  -  July 10, 2022</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Industrial robots</keyword><keyword>Robot Operating System</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword><keyword>Motion analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/CONECCT55679.2022.9865690</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper we propose a novel algorithm to plan paths for multiple robots with multiple goal points.

In this paper is investigated a collective task that requires a multi-robot system to search for randomly distributed mines in an unknown environment and disarm them cooperatively. The communication among the swarm of robots influences the overall performance in terms of time to execute the task or consumed energy. To address this problem, a new distributed recruiting protocol to coordinate a swarm of robots in demining mission, is described. This problem is a multi-objective problem and two bio inspired strategies are used. The novelty of this approach lies in the combination of direct and indirect communication: on one hand an indirect communication among robots is used for the exploration of the environment, on the other hand a novel protocol is used to accomplish the recruiting and coordination of the robots for demining task. This protocol attempts to tackle the question of how autonomous robot can coordinate themselves into an unknown environment relying on simple low-level capabilities. The strategy is able to adapt the current system dynamics if the number of robots or the environment structure or both change. The proposed approach has been implemented and has been evaluated in several simulated environments. We analyzed the impact of our approach in the overall performance of a robot team. Experimental results indicated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed protocol to spread the robots in the environment.  2016 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2228859</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Baltimore, MD, United states</custom1><custom3>Unmanned Systems Technology XVIII, April 20, 2016  -  April 21, 2016</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sarkar, Arindam</author><author>Dey, Joydeep</author><author>Karforma, Sunil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Secured session key-based e-health: Biometric blended with salp swarm protocol in telecare portals</title><tertiary-title>Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>1st International Conference on Global AI Congress, GAIC 2019, September 12, 2019  -  September 14, 2019</full-title></periodical><pages>713-725</pages><volume>1112</volume><keywords><keyword>Benchmarking</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Cryptography</keyword><keyword>Online systems</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH</publisher><isbn>21945357</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-981-15-2188-1_56</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Technological emergence-based user-friendly systems have emerged to cope up the security issues in online medical portals. The Government of India is doing loads of works on online health schemes such as "Ayushman Bharat Yojana." The proposed research technique may be incorporated with existing online portal for secured data transmission. In this proposed methodology, nature-inspired biological algorithm based on salp swarm has been deployed to generate 256-bits session key for secure transmission of medical information. Arruda E.F. et al. have proposed optimal testing policies for diagnosing patients with intermediary probability of disease in the journal of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (Elsevier: June 2019 (Vol. 97)) with no detailed diagnosis of unknown diseases. Moreover, online expert opinion with secured data communication was not present at their technique. This proposed work resolves the stated issues by encrypting the patients fingerprints with lower order session key, and higher order is used for IDEA encrypting the signals. The resultant of both round of encryption is transmitted to a group of known physicians with threshold limits. Several quality testings such as key sensitivity, signal sensitivity, chi-square, session key space, and statistical tests were carried out, and results are compared with existing benchmark techniques.

In this paper we focus on using multiple UAVs to cooperatively monitor a crowded area. Communication in such UAVs network is an ongoing project. Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result. The class of the data as well as other relevant information about the detected event will be used by the GCS to authorize or not UAV data transmission and hence to optimize the bandwidth usage efficiency.  2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2019.8766641</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Tangier, Morocco</custom1><custom3>15th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2019, June 24, 2019  -  June 28, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Jiayong</author><author>Li, Qi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Construction and Analysis of Urban Cultural Plane Space Mode considering Particle Swarm Cultural Scientific Computing Algorithm</title><secondary-title>Security and Communication Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Security and Communication Networks</full-title><abbr-1>Security and Communication Networks</abbr-1></periodical><volume>2022</volume><keywords><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Urban planning</keyword><keyword>Morphology</keyword><keyword>Students</keyword><keyword>Investments</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>19390114</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2022/9838782</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the tide of economic and social internationalization and high-speed urbanization, urban culture has increasingly attracted widespread attention from all walks of life and has a very critical strategic significance in the construction of urban space. This paper aims to construct and analyze the plane space mode of urban culture based on the particle swarm cultural scientific computing algorithm. This article first explains the concept of urban cultural space. Urban cultural space uses urban spatial structure as a media carrier and uses urban cultural time for vertical extension and development; then we proposed the particle swarm cultural scientific calculation algorithm and gave the particle swarm algorithm flowchart; then based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the evaluation of the configuration performance of urban cultural facilities is researched and discussed, and at the same time, the evolution law of urban spatial morphology is explored based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The particle swarm algorithm is a random search algorithm based on group cooperation developed by simulating the foraging behavior of birds. Urban cultural space is the development of urban space based on urban culture. It plays a special and important role in urban cultural development and urban space planning. According to the statistics of the survey and research results, the utilization rate of city-level cultural facilities in City A is 77, the utilization rate of district-level cultural facilities is 72, the utilization rate of street-community cultural facilities is 69, and the overall evaluation score is 70. It shows that there are significant differences in the actual use of cultural facilities, so it is particularly important to eliminate the differences in the use of cultural facilities between urban and rural areas. In the exploration of the law of urban spatial morphology evolution, it is found that the number of college students, total real estate investment, urban population, and total commercial housing sales have a significant impact on urban spatial expansion and evolution.  2022 Jiayong Yu and Qi Li.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/9838782</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Figueira, Nina</author><author>Pochmann, Pablo</author><author>Oliveira, Abel</author><author>De Freitas, Edison Pignaton</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A C4ISR Application on the Swarm Drones Context in a Low Infrastructure Scenario</title><tertiary-title>International Conference on Electrical, Computer, and Energy Technologies, ICECET 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2022 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer, and Energy Technologies, ICECET 2022, July 20, 2022  -  July 22, 2022</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Information management</keyword><keyword>Interoperability</keyword><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Military applications</keyword><keyword>Military operations</keyword><keyword>Data acquisition</keyword><keyword>Air navigation</keyword><keyword>Middleware</keyword><keyword>Command and control systems</keyword><keyword>Software radio</keyword><keyword>Data fusion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICECET55527.2022.9872941</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The military operations in low communications infrastructure scenarios employ flexible solutions to optimize the data processing cycle using situational awareness systems, guaranteeing interoperability and assisting in all processes of decision-making. This paper presents an architecture for the integration of Command, Control, Computing, Communication, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (C4ISR), developed within the scope of the Brazilian Ministry of Defense, in the context of operations with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) - swarm drones - and the Internet-to-the-battlefield (IoBT) concept. This solution comprises the following intelligent subsystems embedded in UAV: STFANET, an SDN-Based Topology Management for Flying Ad Hoc Network focusing drone swarms operations, developed by University of Rio Grande do Sul; Interoperability of Command and Control (INTERC2), an intelligent communication middleware developed by Brazilian Navy; A Mission-Oriented Sensors Array (MOSA), which provides the automatization of data acquisition, data fusion, and data sharing, developed by Brazilian Army; The In-Flight Awareness Augmentation System (IFA2S), which was developed to increase the safety navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), developed by Brazilian Air Force; Data Mining Techniques to optimize the MOSA with data patterns; and an adaptive-collaborative system, composed of a Software Defined Radio (SDR), to solve the identification of electromagnetic signals and a Geographical Information System (GIS) to organize the information processed. This research proposes, as a main contribution in this conceptual phase, an application that describes the premises for increasing the capacity of sensing threats in the low structured zones, such as the Amazon rainforest, using existing communications solutions of Brazilian defense monitoring systems.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICECET55527.2022.9872941</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Prague, Czech republic</custom1><custom3>2022 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer, and Energy Technologies, ICECET 2022, July 20, 2022  -  July 22, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nagarji, Javedkhan</author><author>Arya, Hemendra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulation of Effects of Perturbations and Different Network Topologies on Swarm Cooperative Missions</title><tertiary-title>IFAC-PapersOnLine</tertiary-title></titles><pages>824-829</pages><volume>49</volume><keywords><keyword>Internet protocols</keyword><keyword>Network topology</keyword><keyword>Wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><isbn>24058963</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.03.160</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The consensus protocol used in swarm cooperative mission for different network topologies is studied in the presence of various perturbations.

These UAV-enabled networks can meet several complex mission requirements and are seen as a potential enabler for many of the emerging use-cases in future communication networks. Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and mobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which can cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks are envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their own challenges and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we analyze the key security and resilience issues resulting from the application of wireless mesh networks within UAV swarms. Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of applying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose existing vulnerabilities across the communication stack. Based on this analysis, we present a security-focused architecture for UAV mesh communications.

However, the existing studies focused primarily on cluster-based or multihop protocols individually, which are ineffective in coping with the complex communication scenarios in the railway wireless monitoring system (RWMS). This study proposes a hybrid protocol which combines the cluster-based and multihop protocols (CMCP) to minimize and balance the energy consumption in different sections of the RWMS. In the first hierarchy, the total energy consumption is minimized by optimizing the cluster quantities in the cluster-based protocol and the number of hops and the corresponding hop distances in the multihop protocol. In the second hierarchy, the energy consumption is balanced through rotating the cluster head (CH) in the subnetworks and further optimizing the hops and the corresponding hop distances in the backbone network. On this basis, the system lifetime is maximized with the minimum and balance energy consumption among the sensors. Furthermore, the hybrid particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) are adopted to optimize the energy consumption from the two-layer hierarchy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CMCP is verified in the simulation. The performances of the proposed CMCP in system lifetime, residual energy, and the corresponding variance are all superior to the LEACH protocol widely applied in the previous research. The effective protocol proposed in this study can facilitate the application of the wireless monitoring network in the railway system and enhance safety operation of the railway.  2018 Xiaoping Ma et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/9516342</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Pu</author><author>Yan, Fei</author><author>Liu, Zhao</author><author>Cheng, Guoda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication-constrained task allocation of heterogeneous UAVs</title><secondary-title>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</full-title><abbr-1>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</abbr-1></periodical><volume>42</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10006893</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7527/S1000-6893.2021.25844</electronic-resource-num><abstract>When the heterogeneous multi-UAVs are performing the missions of cooperative reconnaissance and attack, there exists the problem of local task allocation under the constraints of communication distance and time delay. In this paper, a distributed multi-UAV task allocation method is proposed based on the contract net protocol. First, an optimization model of the local task allocation when heterogeneous multi-UAVs discover a new target is established. An information consensus algorithm is designed for the local UAV communication network to solve the conflict in the task announcement process. Then, a coalition formation and resource management method are proposed, so that the UAVs in the coalition can consume the resources in a more balanced way. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem of task allocation of heterogeneous multi-UAV reconnaissance and attack mission under communication constraints, and can obtain the maximum system utility.  2021, Beihang University Aerospace Knowledge Press.

In the traditional architecture for a software-defined network (SDN), the controller commonly uses a general routing algorithm such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), which chooses the shortest path for communication. This may cause the largest amount of network traffic, especially in large-scale environments. In this paper, we present the design for a novel SDN-based four-tier architecture for scalable secure routing and load balancing. In Tier 1, user authentication is conducted using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC); this avoids unnecessary loads from unauthorized users. In Tier 2, packet classification is performed based on the packet characteristics using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP), and packets are placed into three individual queues. In Tier 3, scalable secure routing is achieved by selecting the optimal path using the improved particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization algorithms. With these optimization algorithms, we can adaptively change the number of users, the number of switches, and other parameters. In Tier 4, the recommended secure cluster (multicontroller) management is accomplished using an algorithm that employs modified k-means clustering and a recurrent neural network. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is also proposed for updating the controller information. Experimental results are analyzed using the OMNeT++ network simulator, and the evaluated performance displayed improvement over a variety of existing methods in terms of response time (50% to 60%), load (55%), execution time (3.2%), throughput (9.8%), packet loss rate (1.02%), end-to-end delay (50%), and bandwidth consumption (45%). 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dac.5020</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nallapu, Ravi Teja</author><author>Vance, Leonard D.</author><author>Xu, Yinan</author><author>Thangavelatham, Jekanthan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated Design Architecture for Lunar Constellations</title><tertiary-title>IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020, March 7, 2020  -  March 14, 2020</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Automation</keyword><keyword>Lunar missions</keyword><keyword>Spacecraft</keyword><keyword>Space research</keyword><keyword>Lagrange multipliers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><isbn>1095323X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172381</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Missions to the Moon are actively being developed for its scientific and engineering values. The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) has identified at least twenty enabling and enhancing goals to fulfill the existing lunar exploration Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG). Several of these goals will require multi-asset missions to the surface of the Moon involving human and machine interaction, as well as access to a ground station on Earth. Therefore, a communication enabling constellation deployed around the moon will serve as a crucial enabling technology for such missions. However, the limited orbital stability of lunar orbits constrains the use of traditional central body orbits for designing these constellations. The Earth-Moon Lagrange points, on the other hand, offer a viable location to deploy these constellations. The stationarity of the Lagrange points coupled with the fact that they have a large line of sight access area to the Moon's surface makes them a viable candidate for deploying constellations with a minimal number of spacecraft. However, the design of a Lagrange point constellation mission is not straight forward. This involves selecting the Lagrange points that offer the optimal coverage, optimal quasi-stationary trajectories around these Lagrange points, the optimal transfer to these trajectories, and the design of the constituent spacecraft. Clearly, this multi-disciplinary problem can benefit from a unifying mission design architecture that simultaneously handles the above-mentioned challenges. In our previous work, we developed the Integrated Design Engineering and Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software do design swarm missions to solar system small bodies. This work will focus on extending the capability of the IDEAS architecture to design optimal constellations deployed at the Earth-Moon Lagrange points. The constellation will be designed to act as a relay network to Earth with a minimum number of spacecraft. The performance of the constellation will be noted by studying the accessible regions on the surface of the moon. The approach taken by this work is as follows. We begin by modeling the coverage of spacecraft antenna by studying the accessible areas. The spacecraft will be assumed to be in halo orbits about the colinear Lagrange points. A selection scheme for the halo orbits is then discussed in order to coverage, synchronization, and stability requirements. Finally, the principles described are demonstrated by designing a Lagrange point constellation with three spacecraft that have access to at least 85 % of the Moon's surface and can communicate with at least 70 % of the surface at any given instant. The requirements and performance of this constellation are then evaluated assuming state-of-the-art hardware capabilities. The results indicate successful performance of the developed algorithms thus enabling the IDEAS architecture to generate holistic optimal designs which will greatly increase the returns of the future missions to the Moon.  2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172381</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Big Sky, MT, United states</custom1><custom3>2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020, March 7, 2020  -  March 14, 2020</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selecky, Martin</author><author>Faigl, Jan</author><author>Rollo, Milan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication architecture in mixed-reality simulations of unmanned systems</title><secondary-title>Sensors (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors (Switzerland)</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors (Switzerland)</abbr-1></periodical><volume>18</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Middleware</keyword><keyword>Sensor networks</keyword><keyword>Mixed reality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>14248220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s18030853</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Verification of the correct functionality of multi-vehicle systems in high-fidelity scenarios is required before any deployment of such a complex system, e.g., in missions of remote sensing or in mobile sensor networks. Mixed-reality simulations where both virtual and physical entities can coexist and interact have been shown to be beneficial for development, testing, and verification of such systems. This paper deals with the problems of designing a certain communication subsystem for such highly desirable realistic simulations. Requirements of this communication subsystem, including proper addressing, transparent routing, visibility modeling, or message management, are specified prior to designing an appropriate solution. Then, a suitable architecture of this communication subsystem is proposed together with solutions to the challenges that arise when simultaneous virtual and physical message transmissions occur. The proposed architecture can be utilized as a high-fidelity network simulator for vehicular systems with implicit mobility models that are given by real trajectories of the vehicles. The architecture has been utilized within multiple projects dealing with the development and practical deployment of multi-UAV systems, which support the architectures viability and advantages. The provided experimental results show the achieved similarity of the communication characteristics of the fully deployed hardware setup to the setup utilizing the proposed mixed-reality architecture.  2018 by the authors.

Firstly, the second-order system dynamic model of the UAV is established. Secondly, the attractive potential field function and the repulsive potential field function containing the distance term are defined, and the potential field function between the UAVs considering the influence of communication is designed to realize the control objectives of UAV collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and smoothly reaching the target point. Then, a new consensus control protocol is designed by combining IAPF and consensus theory. UAVs can achieve convergence and consensus of relative distance and speed between the UAVs while maintaining the stability of the formation. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the stability of the system, and simulations are carried out through the formation of four UAVs. The results show that this method can achieve the control objectives of collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and the convergence of position and speed in the formation of trajectory planning.  2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/CCC52363.2021.9550138</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Shanghai, China</custom1><custom3>40th Chinese Control Conference, CCC 2021, July 26, 2021  -  July 28, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Kyusuk</author><author>Nuaimi, Eiman Al</author><author>Blooshi, Shamma Al</author><author>Psiakis, Rafail</author><author>Yeun, Chan Yeob</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A New Scalable Mutual Authentication in Fog-Edge Drone Swarm Environment</title><tertiary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>17th International Conference on Information Security Practice and Experience, ISPEC 2022, November 23, 2022  -  November 25, 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>179-196</pages><volume>13620 LNCS</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Authentication</keyword><keyword>Fog</keyword><keyword>Cryptography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH</publisher><isbn>03029743</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-031-21280-2_10</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A drone swarm is a preferable way in deploying drones for large-scale missions. In establishing drone swarms, secure communication between a fog drone and several edge drones is essential to mutually authenticate each other. Although many research works proposed the designs of mutual authentications, none of them meets the adequate security for the drone swarm environments, requiring either involvement of the ground station during the authentication process or expensive PKI-based crypto operations. Only a few works proposed more lightweight authentication, however, they are still vulnerable to key compromises in addition to the limited flexibility and scalability. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable authentication protocol for fog-edge drone swarm environments, enabling mutual authentication between fog and edges without involving the ground station. We also show the design can leverage various hardware-assisted security functions. Protocol evaluations show security requirements satisfaction while achieving 1420 times less computation overhead as compared to PKI-based models.  2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-21280-2_10</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Taipei, Taiwan</custom1><custom3>17th International Conference on Information Security Practice and Experience, ISPEC 2022, November 23, 2022  -  November 25, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shit, Rathin Chandra</author><author>Goswami, Mrinal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Blockchain use case in multi-sensor satellite architecture</title><tertiary-title>2nd International Conference on Range Technology, ICORT 2021</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2nd International Conference on Range Technology, ICORT 2021, August 5, 2021  -  August 6, 2021</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Network security</keyword><keyword>Blockchain</keyword><keyword>Communication satellites</keyword><keyword>Earth (planet)</keyword><keyword>Space research</keyword><keyword>Distributed ledger</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICORT52730.2021.9581969</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the advent of the multi-sensor satellite system architecture, earth and space exploration such as swarms and constellations are feasible.

The objective of the RAS project is to develop a distributed multi-layer autonomous UAS planning and control technology for gathering intelligence in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) environments populated by intelligent adaptive adversaries. These resilient autonomous systems are able to navigate through hostile environments while collecting intelligence and minimizing the loss of assets. Our approach incorporates artificial life concepts, with the high-level architecture divided into three biologically inspired meta-layers: cyber-physical, reactive, and deliberative. Each meta-layer is a combination of N layers, each representing simple behavior, and collectively having a dynamic level of influence over the behavior of the agent. Algorithms within each layer act on a combination of perceptions, memory, and intents. Perceptions represent a filtered view of reality, abstracted in the layer immediately below, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next highest layer. Intents represent a recommended action output from the layer above, modified in the current layer, and passed to the next lowest layer. Each cycle, perceptions and intents are cleared. Memory permeates each layer, and allows the layers to retain some knowledge from previous cycles. Fast-reactive control systems in low meta-layers ensure a stable environment supporting cognitive function on higher meta-layers. The key concepts of our approach are: A layered architecture of intelligence on a spectrum from reactive to deliberative; the use of artificial life algorithms providing robust, complex behavior from a set of simple rules; communication of information between agents via observation; the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to assist the team in selecting and adapting the best solutions for each layer. This distributed cooperative system of intelligent assets will provide adaptable, scalable performance to accomplish mission goals in challenging environments.  2018 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2018.8569720</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>London, United kingdom</custom1><custom3>37th IEEE/AIAA International Digital Avionics Systems Conference, DASC 2018, September 23, 2018  -  September 27, 2018</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mahdi, Wisam Hayder</author><author>Taspiner, Necmi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overview for Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms (PPSO)</title><tertiary-title>2022 14th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>14th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2022, June 30, 2022  -  July 1, 2022</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ECAI54874.2022.9847459</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The increasing computational cost in complex optimization problems that have a large size resulted in the development of optimization algorithms in parallelization.

The UAV-MTT system has great potentials to execute dull, dangerous, and critical missions for frontier defense and security. A key challenge in UAV-MTT is how to coordinate multiple UAVs to track diverse invading targets accurately and consecutively. In this article, we propose a UAV swarm-based cooperative tracking architecture to systematically improve the UAV tracking performance. We design an intelligent UAV swarm-based cooperative algorithm for consecutive target tracking and physical collision avoidance. Moreover, we design an efficient cooperative algorithm to predict the trajectory of invading targets accurately. Our simulation results demonstrate that the swarm behaviors stay stable in realistic scenarios with perturbing obstacles. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, such as the matched deep $Q$ -network, our algorithms can increase tracking accuracy by 60%, reduce tracking delay by 23%, and achieve physical collision-avoidance during the tracking process.  2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3085673</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jayaweera, Sudharman K.</author><author>Holland, Abriel A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep Learning Cognitive Cooperative Data Scheduling Protocol for Small Spacecraft Swarms</title><tertiary-title>2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2021</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2021, June 21, 2021  -  June 23, 2021</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Deep neural networks</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Scheduling</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Communication satellites</keyword><keyword>Recurrent neural networks</keyword><keyword>Moon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/CCAAW50069.2021.9527293</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A small spacecraft swarm remotely sensing the earth is considered. Sensed observations are to be delivered to an earth station either directly or through geo-stationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite relays with minimal delay. A cognitive cooperative data scheduling (CCDS) protocol is proposed for spacecrafts to leverage node cooperation and deep learning predictions to fully utilize available link capacities in order to minimize data delivery delay. Either periodically, or on an event-driven basis, each satellite predicts its expected sensing data payload and the link capacities to both Earth and GEO stations. Each spacecraft implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) that continuously learns from observed data to predict the amount of expected data over the scheduling horizon. Nodes with extra link capacity than anticipated data, called the relay nodes, broadcast their availability to act as relays to those with more expected data than their link capacities (called the source nodes). Based on neighbor requests, each relay node computes a data acceptance schedule to minimize the overall data delivery delay of the swarm. During the execution phase, source nodes forward their data to the relay nodes over the satellite crosslinks who then forward their payloads to the desired destination. Performance evaluations on a simulated system based on low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite clusters show the promise of the proposed cognitive cooperative data scheduling protocol to significantly reduce the overall data delivery delay of the swarm and to improve utilization of available link capacities. This CCDS protocol can easily be adapted for swarms of small spacecrafts deployed to the Moon, Mars, near-Earth objects (NEOs), and other distant locations for remote sensing missions.  2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCAAW50069.2021.9527293</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Cleveland, OH, United states</custom1><custom3>2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2021, June 21, 2021  -  June 23, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Yibo</author><author>He, Kun</author><author>Meng, Haidong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Formation reconfiguration control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles based on consensus protocol</title><secondary-title>ICIC Express Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ICIC Express Letters</full-title><abbr-1>ICIC Express Letters</abbr-1></periodical><pages>129-136</pages><volume>10</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Aircraft control</keyword><keyword>Graph theory</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1881803X</isbn><abstract>Flight formation of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) needs to be recongured when the environment changes or missions are modied.

Multiple UAVs can cooperatively carry out dangerous applications for human operators or missions where human intervention is not needed, such as surveillance and monitoring of areas of interest and physical infrastructures. Due to the lack of proper communication rules and standards, communication remains one of the most crucial design issues for UAVs swarm. Furthermore, UAVs generally operate in frequency bands shared with other users. Hence, these spectral bands become overcrowded and UAVs may face a spectrum scarcity issue. To address the above challenges, it is essential to define a reliable communication architecture for multiple UAVs coordination and efficient bandwidth sharing. A promising technology that can satisfy the spectrum requirements of the emerging UAVs Networks is Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). The goal is to opportunistically use spectral bands with minimum interference to other users or applications, i.e., primary users. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum scarcity encountered by UAVs. We present a centralized CRN-based communication approach for UAVs-Ground Control Station (GCS) communication. The GCS is used as a central coordinator to handle bandwidth usage for the UAVs swarm in its coverage zone. It selects, allocates, and shares available frequencies using CRN and Software Defined Radio (SDR). To share the available CRN-frequency between the different UAVs in its scope, the GCS uses dynamic Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique. The performance of the proposed communication approach is evaluated in a surveillance context in terms of the total time required to transfer UAVs data, the total number of packets sent, and the achieved throughput.  2021 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108264</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diller, Jonathan</author><author>Hall, Peter</author><author>Schanker, Corey</author><author>Ung, Kristen</author><author>Belous, Philip</author><author>Russell, Peter</author><author>Han, Qi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ICCSwarm: A Framework for Integrated Communication and Control in UAV Swarms</title><tertiary-title>DroNet 2022 - Proceedings of the 2022 8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications, Part of MobiSys 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications, DroNet 2022 - Part of MobiSys 2022, July 1, 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>1-6</pages><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Data acquisition</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Vehicle to vehicle communications</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>NASA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Association for Computing Machinery, Inc</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/3539493.3539579</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have many applications including search and rescue, disaster response, surveillance, infrastructure inspection, among many others.

In this paper we introduce \textit{ICCSwarm}, a framework for integrating communication and control in UAV swarms. \textit{ICCSwarm} consists of two phases, a planning phase where combined communication and motion planning are validated in simulation, and a deployment phase, where a UAV architecture designed around integrated communication and control executes missions from the planning phase on physical UAVs. We implemented \textit{ICCSwarm} on a physical UAV testbed and evaluated its effectiveness through a unique case study in partnership with NASA's JPL.

However, being a technology in development, the security and vulnerability of the swarm of robots against possible cybernetic attacks have been commonly overlooked. This is of major concern when executing mission-critical activities that inherently require an adequate management of security. In this work, a bio-inspired security mechanism applied to a swarm of robots is proposed. Through computer simulations, it is observed how the mechanism, when executing a homing towards a stationary landmark, allows the swarm of robots to identify abnormal behaviors, caused by a certain cyberattack; subsequently, it establishes a certain tolerance to it and allows to improve the level of availability that is required to continue executing the task at hand.  2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-04497-8_26</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Guadalajara, Mexico</custom1><custom3>17th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, MICAI 2018, October 22, 2018  -  October 27, 2018</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kara, Ozan</author><author>Brunner, Melanie</author><author>Birkeland, Roger</author><author>Schor, Dario</author><author>Yaholu, Burak</author><author>Smith, Thomas</author><author>Hornig, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication architecture and international policy recommendations enabling the development of global cubesat space networks</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>66th International Astronautical Congress 2015: Space - The Gateway for Mankind's Future, IAC 2015, October 12, 2015  -  October 16, 2015</full-title></periodical><pages>3737-3745</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Data transfer</keyword><keyword>Delay tolerant networks</keyword><keyword>Budget control</keyword><keyword>Navigation systems</keyword><keyword>Communication satellites</keyword><keyword>Satellite communication systems</keyword><keyword>Optical communication</keyword><keyword>Bandwidth</keyword><keyword>Earth (planet)</keyword><keyword>Data communication systems</keyword><keyword>Radio transmission</keyword><keyword>Standardization</keyword><keyword>Frequency allocation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>International Astronautical Federation, IAF</publisher><isbn>00741795</isbn><abstract>Emerging technologies of CubeSat communication and navigation systems enable new approaches such as larger bandwidths, spectrum and security decrement and high speed communications. In order to create a vantage point, young professionals and students from the four corners of the earth had performed a comprehensive study at the 2014 Space Generation Congress in Toronto, Canada under "CubeSat Swarms Communication Networks and Policy Challenges" working group. While potential possibilities are endless for the structure of Cubesat networks, decisions made amongst the group were based on existing technologies and guidelines. Therefore, the working group discussed (1) short and long term technical challenges (2) policy requirements, (3) radio communication bandwidth limitations, (4) data collection and transmission regulations and (5) the standardization of the CubeSat communication system. Technical challenges for small satellite missions involve limitations of link budgets, the size of the deployable high gain antennas, optical and laser communication and the restriction of the link budget due to the interferences. In addition, policy issues have immaturities for frequency allocation and registration complimenting the short lifespan of CubeSats. The standardization of mission operations enables a space communication network architecture that of which is similar to the internet, incorporated into CubeSat Swarms. The group suggests a CubeSat network system architecture including inter-swarm and intra-swarm constellations, optical and laser communications and delay-tolerant networks (DTN). The proposed CubeSat communication network also consists of inter-swarm constellation communications along with intra-swarm constellations sustained through four different basic data links, a mother-daughter satellite framework, and net-neutrality throughout the network. In the meantime, policy regulation recommendations allow global communication by reducing data downlink time. Governments, as well as service providers, treat all data used online the same regardless of its origins, platform, and users. The standardization of the CubeSat network system was formed by operator expectations for high downlink speeds, equal priority for data transfers, and streamlined registrations. The simplified registration process for CubeSat-Swarms is more efficient by establishing new baseline legal framework, rules, and standards. This would help all users and operators in this sector, including entrepreneurs, licensing bodies, and end-users. Saving time for everyone while achieving maximum efficiency, utilization of the time and results are the end result of proposed system architecture by the working group.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>Jerusalem, Israel</custom1><custom3>66th International Astronautical Congress 2015: Space - The Gateway for Mankind's Future, IAC 2015, October 12, 2015  -  October 16, 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Sung-Chan</author><author>Redwan, Hassen</author><author>Park, Jong-Hong</author><author>Kim, Jaeho</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Build UAV-based Testbeds for Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs) Routing Experimentation</title><tertiary-title>7th Asian/Australian Rotorcraft Forum, ARF 2018</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>7th Asian/Australian Rotorcraft Forum, ARF 2018, October 30, 2018  -  November 1, 2018</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Rock mechanics</keyword><keyword>Ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Testbeds</keyword><keyword>Routing protocols</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Vertical Flight Society</publisher><abstract>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) called drones have received a great amount of interests because it is possible to support various service scenarios based on UAV's flying mobility.

However, to support those scenarios, communication path should be maintained among UAVs and ground control station, therefore guaranteeing a reliable ad hoc network is an important issue. Regarding this, in this paper, we provide development of flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) routing protocol and UAV-based testbeds environments which can be used for the experimentation for the developed routing protocol in which they consist of ground control station (GCS), multi-UAV system, network topology monitor, and 802.11p FANET communication modem.  2019 The Vertical Flight Society.

Since the GCS belongs to the central control architecture, the edge computing system of the distributed architecture gives the drones more flexibility in dealing with changing environmental conditions, allowing them to autonomously and instantly plan their flight path, fly in formation, or even avoid obstacles. Broadcast communications are used to realize UAV-to-UAV communications for allocating tasks among a swarm of UAVs and ensuring each individual collaborates as an integrated member of the group. The dynamic path programming problem for the UAV swarm mission uses a 2-phase Tabu search with the 2-Opt exchange method and A search as the path programming algorithm. Distance is taken as a cost function for path programming. We then increase and expand the turning-points of no-fly zones based on drone fleet coverage, thus preventing drones from entering prohibited areas. Whereas previous work mostly only considers single no-fly zones, this approach accounts for multiple restricted areas, ensuring that a UAV swarm can complete its assigned task without violating no-fly zones. A drone encountering an obstacle while traveling along the route set by the algorithm will update the map information in real-time, allowing for an instant recharting of the optimal path to the goal as a reverse search using the D Lite algorithm.  2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ECICE52819.2021.9645660</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Yunlin, Taiwan</custom1><custom3>3rd IEEE Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering, ECICE 2021, October 29, 2021  -  October 31, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rath, Mihir Kanta</author><author>Deepak, B.B.V.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PSO based system architecture for path planning of mobile robot in dynamic environment</title><tertiary-title>Global Conference on Communication Technologies, GCCT 2015</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Conference on Communication Technologies, GCCT 2015, April 23, 2015  -  April 24, 2015</full-title></periodical><pages>797-801</pages><keywords><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Intelligent robots</keyword><keyword>MATLAB</keyword><keyword>Mobile robots</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/GCCT.2015.7342773</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The proposed research article illustrates the path planning of an intelligent mobile robot in unknown dynamic environment using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The main objective of the problem is to make the robot move from starting position to goal position while avoiding all obstacles and follow the possible shortest path. For solving the path planning problem, a new objective function is developed. By optimizing the developed objective function the global best particle is determined among the swarm. Thereby, the robot moves further towards the global best position. The robot will continuously move to these intermediate positions until it reaches the final destination. Simulation showing navigation of robots towards goal position is done with MATLAB 2013b.  2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GCCT.2015.7342773</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Thuckalay, Kanya Kumari District, India</custom1><custom3>Global Conference on Communication Technologies, GCCT 2015, April 23, 2015  -  April 24, 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freimann, Andreas</author><author>Rummelhagen, Mirko</author><author>Reichel, Florian</author><author>Marszalek, Michael</author><author>Schmidt, Marco</author><author>Schilling, Klaus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of wireless networks for satellite swarm missions</title><tertiary-title>IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline)</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>3rd IFAC Symposium on Telematics Applications, TA 2013, November 11, 2013  -  November 13, 2013</full-title></periodical><pages>68-73</pages><volume>3</volume><keywords><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Space applications</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IFAC Secretariat</publisher><isbn>14746670</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3182/20131111-3-KR-2043.00028</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Swarm missions are a promising approach for novel space applications, increasing operational robustness and flexibility.

Applications such as signal tracking or dynamic object tracking with multiple UAVs allow a cost-effective and minimum-risk alternative to missions which have been historically handled with manned aircraft. As such, for these specific applications, we have developed a micro-avionics architecture structured around an in-house customized open-source autopilot and an indigenous Linux based single board payload/flight management computer. The essential 5-km range telemetry and control link radio is backed up by high-power long-range IEEE 802.11n (WiFi) radio device. The redundancy of communication not only improves the reliability of the avionics architecture, but also enables the trade-off between bandwidth and power efficiency. The architecture is capable of transmitting data at rates above 200 kbps up to 4 km away from its ground station equipped with the developed miniature patch antenna tracker. The payload/flight management computer is ready to run a CSI/USB connected day-light or low-illumination infra-red camera, a USB connected software defined radio and different types of sensor payloads such as radar/lidar range sensors and RGBD cameras. Tied to this architecture, we have designed a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing system with MAVlink communication protocol interlinking hardware to Matlab based UAV dynamic models and tracking algorithms. This system allows comprehensive simulation and testing of designed control and guidance algorithms before flight tests while minimizing cost and crash risk. We have successfully used the avionics architecture in flight tests that involve (a) system identification of flight vehicles and (b) tracking and identification of signal sources using multiple UAVs.  2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICMAE52228.2021.9522365</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Virtual, Athens, Greece</custom1><custom3>12th International Conference on Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, ICMAE 2021, July 16, 2021  -  July 19, 2021</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Zhong</author><author>Gao, Xiaoguang</author><author>Fu, Xiaowei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coalition Formation for Multiple UAVs Cooperative Search and Attack with Communication Constraints in Unknown Environment</title><secondary-title>Transactions of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Transactions of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</full-title><abbr-1>Transactions of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>688-699</pages><volume>34</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Complex networks</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Polynomial approximation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10051120</isbn><abstract>A coalition formation algorithm is presented with limited communication ranges and delays in unknown environment, for the performance of multiple heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in cooperative search and attack missions. The mathematic model of coalition formation is built on basis of the minimum attacking time and the minimum coalition size with satisfying resources and simultaneous strikes requirements. A communication protocol based on maximum number of hops is developed to determine the potential coalition members in dynamic network. A multistage sub-optimal coalition formation algorithm (MSOCFA) with polynomial time is established. The performances of MSOCFA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are compared in terms of complexity, mission performance and computational time. A complex scenario is deployed to illustrate how the coalitions are formed and validate the feasibility of the MSOCFA. The effect of communication constraints (hop delay and max-hops) on mission performance is studied. The results show that it is beneficial to determine potential coalition members in a wide and deep range over the network in the presence of less delay. However, when the delays are significant, it is more advantageous to determine coalitions from among the immediate neighbors.  2017, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

Securing the communication taking place with the drones and especially in the network of a swarm, is of primary importance to allow a safe integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles into air traffic. Drones are subject to a range of attacks, from GPS jamming to application bug exploits. Among these attacks, and irrespective to whether they have already been implemented or not, communication is one of the main contributors, both as a vector and as a target. In this article, we use previous work on security threats concerning drones to identify two main types of attack in a network of drones: intrusion from the outside and network usage from inside. We demonstrate the robustness of the Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture facing most common attacks from the outside. In addition, we propose a traffic injection detection technique and corresponding countermeasures based on SDN flow counters. Finally, we present an innovative machine learning solution based on Random Forest Classifier to address insider attacks, relying solely on flow creation events. We propose two specific features that characterizes the activity in the network. They allow detecting common network attacks such as denial of service, port scanning and brute force and are easily available to the controller. Detection performance of these abnormal behaviors are promising, both in terms of true positive and false negative, and in terms of detection delay. Detection of these common attacks will allow tightening of security in such wireless network by denying further access to the network by rogue nodes.  2021 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2021.102940</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mehra, Raman K.</author><author>Bokovi, Jovan D.</author><author>Knoebel, Nathan</author><author>Moshtagh, Nima</author><author>Amin, Jayesh</author><author>Larson, Gregory L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collaborative Mission Planning &amp; Autonomous Control Technologies (COMPACT) for complex UAV missions</title><tertiary-title>AUVSI Unmanned Systems North America Conference 2009</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AUVSI Unmanned Systems North America Conference 2009, August 10, 2009  -  August 13, 2009</full-title></periodical><pages>716-734</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Memory architecture</keyword><keyword>MATLAB</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International</publisher><abstract>In this paper an autonomous hierarchical architecture for controlling swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is investigated. Its purpose is to carry out complex missions involving Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Suppression of Enemy Aerial Defenses (SEAD), Destruction of Enemy Aerial Defenses (DEAD), Close Air Support (CAS), and other functions in an environment characterized by large uncertainty and vehicle loss or failures. Our approach is referred to as the Collaborative Mission Planning &amp; Autonomous Control Technology (CoMPACT) encompassing tasks and objectives from the mission planning stage to the UAV task execution level. The main advantage of the CoMPACT system is that it effectively combines mission planning using evolutionary algorithms, hybrid automata-based task execution, and biologically-inspired emergent swarm behaviors. Judicious combination and coordination of these capabilities results in a system that is scalable to architectures involving a very large number of autonomous agents in which mission-relevant objectives are accomplished in highly uncertain dynamic environments through real-time mission re-planning, dynamic agent-to-task assignment, and reactive motion planning. Through simulation and experiment, the CoMPACT approach is shown to be robust to intermittent loss of communications and communication delays, and to dynamic changes in the environment such as moving targets, unknown targets and obstacles, pop-up threats, vehicular failures and loss of agents. The CoMPACT system has been extensively tested on a Matlab simulation of a realistic mission scenario involving ISR, SEAD and DEAD functions, and simple models of UAV dynamics operating in a dynamic threat and target-rich environment. The CoMPACT system has also been implemented and field tested for maritime applications in a companion AUVSI paper [42].</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>Washington, DC, United states</custom1><custom3>AUVSI Unmanned Systems North America Conference 2009, August 10, 2009  -  August 13, 2009</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roy, Sharadindu</author><author>Banerjee, Siddhartha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>3D IC Partitioning Approach for Achieving Lower TSV Count and Reduced Heat Dissipation using Particle Swarm Optimization</title><tertiary-title>2022 1st International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies, ICEEICT 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>1st International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies, ICEEICT 2022, February 16, 2022  -  February 18, 2022</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Benchmarking</keyword><keyword>Heuristic methods</keyword><keyword>Integrated circuit design</keyword><keyword>Electronics packaging</keyword><keyword>Integrated circuit interconnects</keyword><keyword>Silicon</keyword><keyword>Three dimensional integrated circuits</keyword><keyword>Timing circuits</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICEEICT53079.2022.9768552</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Partitioning is the preliminary stage in the VLSI physical design process, and it impacts the outcome of all following physical design steps such as floor planning, placement, pin assignment, and routing. Initial incorrect partitioning may influence the overall quality of the final architecture. In this paper Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based meta-heuristic methodologies has been tried for solving 3D IC partitioning problems. The proposed methodology minimizes number of Through Silicon Vias (TSV) and reduces heat dissipation in 3D IC partitioning. Large number of TSVs increases the chip area. Thus TSV minimization has an important role in 3D IC partitioning. Due to enhanced technology scaling and an increasing number of components with higher frequency, 3D chips have substantially higher power densities. The chip's performance and dependability are influenced by the heat dissipated by the employed power. The proposed method is also capable for reducing the heat dissipation of the entire chip. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using 3D-IC benchmark and the performance is compared with existing method. The experimental result shows that the proposed technique improves number of TSVs and required implementation area by up to 14.45% and 10.69% respectively with respect to existing method.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT53079.2022.9768552</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Trichy, India</custom1><custom3>1st International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies, ICEEICT 2022, February 16, 2022  -  February 18, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shenoy, Meetha V.</author><author>Anupama, K.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DTTA - Distributed, time-division multiple access based task allocation framework for swarm robots</title><secondary-title>Defence Science Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Defence Science Journal</full-title><abbr-1>Defence Science Journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>316-324</pages><volume>67</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Cost effectiveness</keyword><keyword>Robots</keyword><keyword>Disasters</keyword><keyword>Time division multiple access</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0011748X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.14429/dsj.67.10995</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Swarm robotic systems, unlike traditional multi-robotic systems, deploy number of cost effective robots which can co-operate, aggregate to form patterns/formations and accomplish missions beyond the capabilities of individual robot. In the event of fire, mine collapse or disasters like earthquake, swarm of robots can enter the area, conduct rescue operations, collect images and convey locations of interest to the rescue team and enable them to plan their approach in advance. Task allocation among members of the swarm is a critical and challenging problem to be addressed. DTTA- a distributed, Time-division multiple access (TDMA) based task allocation framework is proposed for swarm of robots which can be utilised to solve any of the 8 different types of task allocation problem identified by Gerkey and Mataric'. DTTA is reactive and supports task migration via extended task assignments to complete the mission in case of failure of the assigned robot to complete the task. DTTA can be utilised for any kind of robot in land or for co-operative systems comprising of land robots and air-borne drones. Dependencies with other layers of the protocol stack were identified and a quantitative analysis of communication and computational complexity is provided. To our knowledge this is the first work to be reported on task allocation for clustered scalable networks suitable for handling all 8 types of multi-robot task allocation problem. Effectiveness and feasibility of deploying DTTA in real world scenarios is demonstrated by testing the framework for two diverse application scenarios.  2017, DESIDOC.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.14429/dsj.67.10995</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheriguene, Youssra</author><author>Djellikh, Soumia</author><author>Bousbaa, Fatima Zohra</author><author>Lagraa, Nasreddine</author><author>Lakas, Abderrahmane</author><author>Kerrache, Chaker Abdelaziz</author><author>Karim Tahari, Abdou El</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SEMRP: An Energy-efficient Multicast Routing Protocol for UAV Swarms</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications, DS-RT 2020</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>24th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications, DS-RT 2020, September 14, 2020  -  September 16, 2020</full-title></periodical><pages>ACM SIGSIM; IEEE Computer Society</pages><keywords><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Energy efficiency</keyword><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Vehicular ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Multicasting</keyword><keyword>Power management (telecommunication)</keyword><keyword>Routing protocols</keyword><keyword>Packet networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/DS-RT50469.2020.9213700</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The deployment of a swarm of cooperative UAVs applications for the execution of distributed tasks has increased attention from both academia and industry researchers. The use of a group of UAVs instead of one single UAV offers many advantages like extending the mission coverage, providing a reliable ad-hoc networks services, and enhancing the service performance, to name a few. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of the swarm topology, the coordination of a large number of UAVs poses new challenges to traditional inter-UAV communication protocols. Therefore, there is a need for the design of new networking protocols that can efficiently support the fast-pace and real-time requirements of a coordinated swarm navigation in various environments. In this paper, we propose SEMRP a Swarm energy-efficient multicast routing protocol for UAVs flying in group formations. The main purpose of SEMRP is to facilitate the control and information delivery between UAVs while minimizing inter-UAV packet loss, packet re-transmission, and end-to-end delay. In this study we show how SEMRP achieves these objectives by taking into account various Quality-of-Service parameters like the network throughput, the UAVs mobility, and energy efficiency to ensure a timely and accurate information delivery to all members of a UAV swarm. The results of the conducted simulation using NS-2 advocate for the efficiency of our proposal through its to two presented versions (SEMRP-v1 and SEMRP-v2) in term of reducing the total emission energy (at least by 10 dBm), optimizing the End-to-End Delay by 44%, and increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol.  2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DS-RT50469.2020.9213700</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Prague, Czech republic</custom1><custom3>24th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications, DS-RT 2020, September 14, 2020  -  September 16, 2020</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gupta, Lav</author><author>Jain, Raj</author><author>Vaszkun, Gabor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Survey of Important Issues in UAV Communication Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1123-1152</pages><volume>18</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Vehicle to vehicle communications</keyword><keyword>Energy efficiency</keyword><keyword>Topology</keyword><keyword>Surveys</keyword><keyword>Vehicular ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Software defined networking</keyword><keyword>Mesh generation</keyword><keyword>MESH networking</keyword><keyword>Wireless mesh networks (WMN)</keyword><keyword>Network routing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553877X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/COMST.2015.2495297</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enormous potential in the public and civil domains. These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas.  1998-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2495297</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhen, Ran</author><author>Jin, Yating</author><author>Wu, Xiaojing</author><author>Wu, Xueli</author><author>Lv, Xuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fault-Tolerant Time-Varying Formation Tracking Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm Systems with Switching Topologies</title><secondary-title>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</full-title><abbr-1>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</abbr-1></periodical><volume>2021</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Navigation</keyword><keyword>Aircraft detection</keyword><keyword>Aircraft control</keyword><keyword>Fault tolerance</keyword><keyword>Graph theory</keyword><keyword>Lyapunov functions</keyword><keyword>Actuators</keyword><keyword>Riccati equations</keyword><keyword>Time varying control systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1024123X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2021/5519243</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper investigates fault-tolerant time-varying formation tracking control problems for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems with switching topologies.

The control protocol does not depend on the information of the actuator fault boundary by using adaptive technology. Then, by constructing a reasonable Lyapunov function and solving the algebraic Riccati equation, the stability of the designed controller is proved. For UAV swarm systems with switching topologies and actuator faults, the formation tracking control protocol designed is adopted to enable the followers form the desired time-varying formation and track the leader's status at the same time. Finally, the simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.  2021 Ran Zhen et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/5519243</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xinqing, Zou</author><author>Na, Lv</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Content Driven Routing Protocol of the Software-defined Information-Centric Airborne Tactical Network</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of 2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications, ICAICA 2019</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications, ICAICA 2019, March 29, 2019  -  March 31, 2019</full-title></periodical><pages>198-204</pages><keywords><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Software defined networking</keyword><keyword>Internet protocols</keyword><keyword>Routing protocols</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICAICA.2019.8873524</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The traditional airborne tactical network (ATN) is tightly coupled to combat applications and does not take into account the information content itself, the routing protocols of current ATNs cannot provide differentiated communication services for different information content, leading to the difficulty of meeting the communication requirements of the diverse operational platforms and various operational missions of the aviation swarm.

Complex formation configurations can be of interest to be the central element in an exhibition or maximize surface coverage for surveillance of a specific area. Existing algorithms that enable complex configurations usually require a centralized control, a communication protocol among the swarm in order to achieve consensus, or predefined instructions for individual agents. Nonetheless, trivial shapes such as flocks can be accomplished with low sensing and interaction requirements. We propose a pattern formation algorithm that enables a variety of shape configurations with a distributed, communication-free and index-free implementation with collision avoidance. Our algorithm is based on a formation definition that does not require indexing of the agents. We show the potential of the algorithm by simulating the formation of non-trivial shapes such as a wedge and a T-shaped configuration. We compare the performance of the algorithm for single and double integrator models for the dynamics of the agents. Finally, we run a preliminary test of our algorithm by implementing it with a group of small cars equipped with a Lidar for sensing and orientation calculation.  2019 The Authors.

For instance, it could be possible to have a team of UAV acting as weather sensors improving the performance of a SWIM weather application. In this context, and due to the autonomous nature of the UAVs, it is possible to embed autonomous decision-making tools in the software on-board the UAVs for providing services in the SWIM architecture. Furthermore, to increase the robustness of the system w.r.t. the communication infrastructure limitations, distributed autonomous decision tools are considered instead of centralized decision-making. An important issue in distributed multi-UAV coordination is the distributed task allocation problem that has recently become a key research topic. Our approach to the distributed task allocation problem considers the application of market-based negotiation rules. Based on this method, the UAVs themselves will autonomously decide which one will be endowed with each task. In the missions considered in the paper, a team of UAVs has to provide services to a SWIM application. Those services have been modeled by tasks consisting in visiting waypoints transmitting data in real time. The distributed execution of the algorithm applied in the paper will compute which UAV will visit each waypoint during the mission. Moreover, the algorithm will also create and allocate communication relay tasks if the limited communication range does not allow to send the data in real-time. The paper shows the result of several simulations considering different communication ranges.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>Bretigny-sur-Orge, France</custom1><custom3>6th EUROCONTROL Innovative Research Workshop and Exhibition: Disseminating ATM Innovative Research, December 4, 2007  -  December 6, 2007</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbier, Magali</author><author>Bensana, Eric</author><author>Pucel, Xavier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A generic and modular architecture for maritime autonomous vehicles</title><tertiary-title>AUV 2018 - 2018 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Workshop, Proceedings</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2018 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Workshop, AUV 2018, November 6, 2018  -  November 9, 2018</full-title></periodical><pages>APDL; et al.; Evo Logics; Kongsberg; Ocean Infinity; OceanScan - Marine Systems and Technology</pages><keywords><keyword>Software architecture</keyword><keyword>Autonomous vehicles</keyword><keyword>Uncertainty analysis</keyword><keyword>Offshore oil well production</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/AUV.2018.8729765</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Autonomous systems face the challenge of managing disruptive events such as internal alterations, mission updates and environmental perturbations that always occur in an operational context. Autonomous vehicles must embed the capabilities to supervise their behaviour and to detect and react to such events. The complexity increases with the heterogeneity of vehicles in the team and the communication constraints. This paper describes the Robot System Onboard Architecture (RSOA) software developed in the SWARMs project for the achievement of offshore maritime operations. This generic and modular architecture implements high level capabilities in a semiautonomous or autonomous manner, and is deployed at a lower level on a heterogeneous swarm of vehicles. Target vehicles include autonomous and teleoperated underwater vehicles, and surface vehicles.

The new developments extend the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's CARACaS (Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing) autonomy architecture, which provides foundational software infrastructure, core executive functions, and several default robotic technology modules. In Swarm II, CARACaS demonstrated higher levels of autonomy and more complex cooperation than previous on-water exercises, using full-sized vehicles and real-world sensing and communication. The core autonomous behaviors to support the harbor patrol scenario included Patrol, Track, Inspect, and Trail, providing the capability of finding all vessels entering the patrol area, keeping track of them, inspecting them to infer intent, and trailing suspect vessels. Significantly, CARACaS assumed responsibility for not only executing tasks safely and efficiently but also recognizing what tasks needed to be accomplished, given the current state of the world. Since the heterogeneous USV teams shared world model that evolved, such as due to (dis) appearance of vessels in the area or a change in health or availability of a USV, CARACaS replanned to generate and reallocate the new task list. Thus, human intervention was never required in the loop to task USVs during mission execution, though a supervisory role was supported in the autonomy system for mission monitoring and exception handling. Finally, CARACaS also ensured the USVs avoided hazards and obeyed the applicable rules of the road, using its local motion planning modules.  2017 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2262067</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Anaheim, CA, United states</custom1><custom3>Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017  -  April 13, 2017</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Preiss, James A.</author><author>Honig, Wolfgang</author><author>Sukhatme, Gaurav S.</author><author>Ayanian, Nora</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crazyswarm: A large nano-quadcopter swarm</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2017, May 29, 2017  -  June 3, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>3299-3304</pages><volume>0</volume><keywords><keyword>Vehicle to vehicle communications</keyword><keyword>Vehicles</keyword><keyword>State estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><isbn>10504729</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989376</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We define a system architecture for a large swarm of miniature quadcopters flying in dense formation indoors.

The small ducted-fan UAVs are designed and fabricated in-house with electric propulsion, taking into account the flight experiment environment. The controller design for a single UAV is verified in a six degree-of-freedom dynamic simulation environment, ground testing, and flight experiments for waypoint navigation. The guidance law for formation flight is designed based mainly on a leader-follower scheme, and its applicability is verified through software in-the-loop tests. In the flight experiments, each ducted-fan UAV is equipped with a Pixhawk flight control board and a Raspberry Pi 3 board for UDP communication between UAVs. Data communication between the ducted-fan UAVs and other computers is performed using a MAVProxy protocol.

Moreover, mobile sinks ought to first collect data from nodes which have very important and dense data so that packet collision and loss can be prevented at an advanced level. For these purposes, the present paper proposes a new mobile path planning protocol by introducing priority-ordered dependent nonparametric trees (PoDNTs) for WSNs. Unlike traditional clustered or swarm intelligence topology-based routing methods, a topology which has hierarchical and dependent infinite tree structure provides a robust link connection between nodes, making it easier to reselect ancestor nodes (ANs). The proposed priority-ordered infinite trees are sampled in the specific time frames by introducing new equations and hierarchically associated with their child nodes starting from the root node. Hence, the nodes with the highest priority and energy that belong to the constructed tree family are selected as ANs with an opportunistic approach. A mobile sink simply visits these ANs to acquire data from all nodes in the network and return to where it started. As a result, the route traveled is assigned as the mobile path for the current round. We have performed comprehensive performance analysis to illustrate the effectiveness of the present study using NS-2 simulation environment. The present routing protocol has achieved better results than the other algorithms over various performance metrics. 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dac.4449</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leng, Yuquan</author><author>Zhang, Yang</author><author>He, Xu</author><author>Zhou, Weijia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Algorithm for foraging and building task on a novel swarm robotic platform</title><tertiary-title>2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, IEEE ROBIO 2014</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, IEEE ROBIO 2014, December 5, 2014  -  December 10, 2014</full-title></periodical><pages>2501-2506</pages><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Human computer interaction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090716</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Foraging Task is a typical task on swarm robotic and Building Task (extend from blocks world) is widely used for testing performance of task planning in multi-robots.

Multi-UAV systems organized in an ad hoc fashion called a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can cooperatively and collaboratively accomplish complex missions more efficiently compared to single large UAV systems. However, the unique features of FANETs such as high mobility, low node density, and high frequency of topology changes introduce challenges to the communication design, especially routing. Thus, the routing requirements of FANETs surpass those of MANETs or VANETs. In this paper, we present UAV classification, communication and application architectures, and an exhaustive survey of the existing routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks. Furthermore, we highlight the key features, strengths and weaknesses, and different mobility models used for the performance evaluation of the existing FANET routing protocols. More importantly, a proposed taxonomy and a review on the existing FANET routing protocols are presented. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges and open research issues.  1998-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2020.2982452</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carpentiero, Marco</author><author>Sabatini, Marco</author><author>Palmerini, Giovanni B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Swarm of autonomous rovers for cooperative planetary exploration</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>68th International Astronautical Congress: Unlocking Imagination, Fostering Innovation and Strengthening Security, IAC 2017, September 25, 2017  -  September 29, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>9437-9442</pages><volume>14</volume><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Computation theory</keyword><keyword>Remote control</keyword><keyword>Intelligent robots</keyword><keyword>Rovers</keyword><keyword>Control theory</keyword><keyword>Navigation systems</keyword><keyword>Interplanetary spacecraft</keyword><keyword>Asteroids</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>International Astronautical Federation, IAF</publisher><isbn>00741795</isbn><abstract>The improvements in computational power, miniaturization processes, sensors and robotics technology allow today to realize low cost, small and multi-tasking mobile robotic platforms with high level of artificial intelligence. In addition, the increasing capabilities of the computer vision in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and obstacles localization allow to integrate an efficient and robust multi-vision based navigation system thus supplying learning capacity. This architecture is typical of an autonomous rover, i.e. a mobile platform which is able to navigate, to plan and follow a safe path without human remote control. These skills are obviously mandatory requirements for space missions like planetary or asteroid exploration. Till now, typical missions has been characterized by non-cooperative autonomous rovers working in different and quite far areas. Increased availability of performing autonomous platforms now suggests to plan missions involving a swarm of cooperative rovers exploring a predefined area of a planet, an asteroid or a comet, with a common target. Coordination leads to versatility and lower cost in terms of data return. The logic of cooperation is based on the fact that each member of the swarm shares a set of information that might help the others in achieving their tasks. The paper describes a possible system architecture of a swarm of two small rovers designed, built and tested at the Guidance and Navigation Lab of Universita di Roma "La Sapienza". The goal of the mission is to reach a common and pre-assigned target position - a hypothetic scientific post on the surface of a planet - while exploring and analysing the surrounding environment. The coordinates of a localised obstacles are shared with the other member in order to build a common and continuously upgradable map of the environment and a database of available safe paths. The whole architecture of the designed autonomous guidance and vision-based navigation system together with the communication system are presented in detail.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>Adelaide, SA, Australia</custom1><custom3>68th International Astronautical Congress: Unlocking Imagination, Fostering Innovation and Strengthening Security, IAC 2017, September 25, 2017  -  September 29, 2017</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seidel, Martin</author><author>Zug, Sebastian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Context aware architecture for distributed robotics</title><tertiary-title>IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>21st IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2016, September 6, 2016  -  September 9, 2016</full-title></periodical><volume>2016-November</volume><keywords><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Industrial robots</keyword><keyword>Multipurpose robots</keyword><keyword>Bandwidth</keyword><keyword>Robot applications</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><isbn>19460740</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733646</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Multi-robot applications in industrial scenarios have to cover a large spectrum of tasks reaching from low level control functions on the machine level up to high level coordination tasks. The configuration of these tasks related to single or multi-robot algorithms depends on the individual requirements of the scenario (i.e. number of entities, communication bandwidth, failure assumptions). Therefore, the developer may decide to run a path planning algorithm individually for each robot to avoid an additional exchange of information. For a scenario with a large communication bandwidth, a planner in the global context would be more suitable in order to receive an optimal result. In this paper we present an architecture that implements this decision online. Our context-aware task controller evaluates the communication situation and triggers a context switch (global, local, individual) of the task execution. By shifting the decision from design-time to run-time, we close the gap between supervision and swarm approaches and provide an optimized behavior.  2016 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733646</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Berlin, Germany</custom1><custom3>21st IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2016, September 6, 2016  -  September 9, 2016</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Kai</author><author>Zhao, Liqiang</author><author>Liu, Yalina</author><author>Liu, Qingxue</author><author>Yang, Kun</author><author>Sun, Zhili</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhanced IEEE 802.11 MAC Protocol for Precision Formation Flying-Based Distributed Spacecraft</title><secondary-title>Wireless Personal Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wireless Personal Communications</full-title><abbr-1>Wireless Personal Communications</abbr-1></periodical><pages>375-388</pages><volume>79</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Energy utilization</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>IEEE Standards</keyword><keyword>Quality control</keyword><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Network topology</keyword><keyword>Spacecraft</keyword><keyword>Medium access control</keyword><keyword>Frequency domain analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>09296212</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11277-014-1862-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In order to support precision formation flying missions, distributed spacecraft require inter-spacecraft communications with required performance.

The following idea is proved: development of Earth remote sensing systems needs changing of approach to planning of their application. Problem statement is described. As criteria of efficiency, information delivery time, resolution and cost of request execution are used. The schedule has to comply with the following constraints: visibility between satellites, observation areas and data receiving points, storage capacity of the memory unit as well as coordination of operations on shooting, storing, transmitting and receiving data. Review of ways of problem solution is provided. Implementation of the approach has been suggested, where the sought schedule is built as dynamic balancing of interests of satellites, data receiving points and observation area agents. Multi-agent planning system is developed. Architecture of the system is described as well as functions of the modules it includes. Dynamically occurring events are taken into account when planning, including introduction of a new task or change of task options, failure of a satellite or means of communication. The experimental assessment of time spent on recovery of the damaged schedule is given. In conclusion benefits of the multi-agent approach at management of swarm of Earth remote sensing satellites are provided.  2017 The Authors.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2017.01.127</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Moscow, Russia</custom1><custom3>12th International Symposium Intelligent Systems, INTELS 2016, October 5, 2016  -  October 7, 2016</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fitwi, Alem H.</author><author>Nagothu, Deeraj</author><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Blasch, Erik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Distributed Agent-Based Framework for a Constellation of Drones in a Military Operation</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 Winter Simulation Conference, WSC 2019, December 8, 2019  -  December 11, 2019</full-title></periodical><pages>2548-2559</pages><volume>2019-December</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Military operations</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Information dissemination</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Denial-of-service attack</keyword><keyword>Peer to peer networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><isbn>08917736</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/WSC40007.2019.9004907</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A seamless communication capability is important in military operations. Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise.  2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WSC40007.2019.9004907</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>National Harbor, MD, United states</custom1><custom3>2019 Winter Simulation Conference, WSC 2019, December 8, 2019  -  December 11, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lakas, Abderrahmane</author><author>Belkacem, Abdelkader Nasreddine</author><author>Al Hassani, Shamsa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Adaptive Multi-clustered Scheme for Autonomous UAV Swarms</title><tertiary-title>2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, IWCMC 2020</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>16th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2020, June 15, 2020  -  June 19, 2020</full-title></periodical><pages>1567-1572</pages><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Military applications</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Air navigation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148449</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Swarm technology for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has gained popularity in the last few years due to their potential for civilian and military applications. Intelligent swarm systems are very efficient at solving group-level problems and their capability to accomplish complex missions with no or little human intervention. One of the most challenging problems is operating in environments with surrounding obstacles such as buildings, thus, often obstructing inter-UAV communication. A UAV swarm is required to maintain continuous communication between its members and preserve the stability of its formation while flying towards an ultimate goal. In this paper we propose MSCS, a new cooperative and adaptive scheme for multi-clustered autonomous UAV swarms. This schemes allows several UAVs operating in a swarm formation to coordinate their navigation and path planning operations by using an adaptive multi-clustered leader-follower approach. The swarm members follow a dynamically elected leader based on the UAV with best fit to lead the swarm towards the destination. The coordination of the UAVs is achieved through SBP (Swarm Broadcast Protocol), a single-hop broadcast UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication protocol, which allows swarm members to exchange information about their current location and their local cluster leader. We present a set of performance results, which show that this scheme contributes efficiently at maintaining the swarm formation's stability at acceptable density and disconnection ratio.  2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148449</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Limassol, Cyprus</custom1><custom3>16th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference, IWCMC 2020, June 15, 2020  -  June 19, 2020</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bokovi, Jovan D.</author><author>Knoebel, Nathan</author><author>Moshtagh, Nima</author><author>Amin, Jayesh</author><author>Larsonk, Gregory L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collaborative Mission Planning &amp; Autonomous Control Technology (CoMPACT) system employing swarms of UAVs</title><tertiary-title>AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference and Exhibit</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference and Exhibit</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Memory architecture</keyword><keyword>MATLAB</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.</publisher><abstract>In this paper an autonomous hierarchical architecture for controlling swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is investigated. Its purpose is to carry out complex missions involving Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Suppression of Enemy Aerial Defenses (SEAD), Destruction of Enemy Aerial Defenses (DEAD), Close Air Support (CAS), and other functions in an environment characterized by large uncertainty and vehicle loss or failures. The architecture is referred to as the Collaborative Mission Planning &amp; Autonomous Control Technology (CoMPACT) and consists of six coordinated hierarchical layers encompassing tasks and objectives from the mission planning stage to the UAV task execution level. The main advantage of the CoMPACT system is that it effectively combines mission planning using evolutionary algorithms, hybrid automata-based task execution at each hierarchical layer, and biologically-inspired emergent swarm behaviors. Judicious combination and coordination of these capabilities results in a system that is scalable to architectures involving a very large number of autonomous agents in which mission-relevant objectives are accomplished in highly uncertain dynamic environments through real-time mission re-planning, dynamic agent-to-task assignment, and reactive motion planning. Through simulation and experiment, the CoMPACT system is shown to be robust to intermittent loss of communications and communication delays, and to dynamic changes in the environment such as moving targets, unknown targets and obstacles, pop-up threats, vehicular failures and loss of agents. The CoMPACT system has been extensively tested on a Matlab simulation of a realistic mission scenario involving ISR, SEAD and DEAD functions, and simple models of UAV dynamics operating in a dynamic threat and target-rich environment.

Due to the limited communication range between readers and tags, how to configure a RFID system in a large area is important but challenging. To configure a RFID system, most existing results are based on cost minimization through using 0/1 identification model. In practice, the system is interfered by environment and probabilistic model would be more reliable. To make sure the quality of the system, more objectives, such as interference and coverage, should be considered in addition to cost. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic-based multi-objective optimization model to address these challenges. The objectives to be optimized include number of readers, interference level and coverage of tags. A decomposition-based firefly algorithm is designed to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. Virtual force is integrated into random walk to guide readers moving in order to enhance exploitation. Numerical simulations are introduced to demonstrate and validate our proposed method. Comparing with existing methods, such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization approaches, our proposed method can achieve better performance in terms of quality metric and generational distance under the same computational environment. However, the spacing metric of the proposed method is slightly inferior to those compared methods.  2017 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2017.02.009</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiandong, Zhang</author><author>Qiming, Yang</author><author>Guoqing, Shi</author><author>Yi, Lu</author><author>Yong, Wu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision based on multi-agent reinforcement learning</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1421-1438</pages><volume>32</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Military vehicles</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword><keyword>Recurrent neural networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>16711793</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.23919/JSEE.2021.000121</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In order to improve the autonomous ability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to implement air combat mission, many artificial intelligence-based autonomous air combat maneuver decision-making studies have been carried out, but these studies are often aimed at individual decision-making in 1v1 scenarios which rarely happen in actual air combat. Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation.  1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/JSEE.2021.000121</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bibi, Rida</author><author>Chowdhry, Bhawani Shankar</author><author>Shah, Reehan Ali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PSO based localization of multiple mobile robots emplying LEGO EV3</title><tertiary-title>2018 International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Engineering Technologies: Invent, Innovate and Integrate for Socioeconomic Development, iCoMET 2018 - Proceedings</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2018 International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Engineering Technologies, iCoMET 2018, March 3, 2018  -  March 4, 2018</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><volume>2018-January</volume><keywords><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Computational complexity</keyword><keyword>Mobile robots</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICOMET.2018.8346452</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The problem of robotic path planning is one of the most noteworthy task in mobile robots. Control the path of robot to reach at the exact target without effecting by environmental conditions is the most difficult task to obtain. Multi-Robotic path planning is a challenging computational problem seduce in robotics because of its complexity and high cost by the number of robots. Path planning of multi robots using particle swarm optimization algorithm somehow reduces complexity. This work introduces a new algorithm of path planning using PSO techniques and displays a model of path planning of robots in a square and obstacle free environment.

However, the performance of the VANET depends on the routing protocol in accord with the delay and throughput requirements. Many of the routing protocols have been extensively studied in the literature. Although there are exemptions, they escalate research challenges in traffic aware routing (TAR) protocol of VANET. This paper introduces the fractional glowworm swarm optimization (FGWSO) for the TAR protocol of VANET in an urban scenario that can identify the optimal path for the vehicle with less traffic density and delay time. The proposed FGWSO searches the optimal routing path based on the fitness function formulated in this paper. Fractional glowworm swarm optimization is the combination of the GWSO and fractional theory. Moreover, exponential weighted moving average is utilized to predict the traffic density and the speed of the vehicle, which is utilized as the major constraints in the fitness function of the optimization algorithm to find the optimal traffic aware path. Simulation of FGWSO shows the significant improvement with a minimal end-to-end delay of 6.6395seconds and distance of 17.3962m, respectively, in comparison with the other existing routing approaches. The simulation also validates the optimality of the proposed TAR protocol.

Holonic manufacturing systems (HMS) provide a flexible and decentralised manufacturing environment to accommodate changes dynamically. HMS is based on the notion of holon, an autonomous, co-operative and intelligent entity which is able to collaborate with other holons to complete the tasks. HMS requires a robust coordination and collaboration mechanism to allocate available resources to achieve the production goals. In this paper, a basic integrated process planning and scheduling system, which is applicable to the holonic manufacturing systems is presented. A basic architecture of holonic manufacturing system is proposed from the viewpoint of the process planning and the scheduling systems. Here, the process planning is defined as a process to select suitable machining sequences of machining features and suitable operation sequences of machining equipments, taking into consideration the short-term and long-term capacities of machining equipments. A fuzzy inference system (FIS), in choosing alternative machines for integrated process planning and scheduling of a job shop in HMS, is presented. Instead of choosing alternative machines randomly, machines are being selected based on the machine's capacity. The mean time for failure (MTF) values are input in a fuzzy inference mechanism, which outputs the machine reliability. The machine is then being penalised based on the fuzzy output. The most reliable machine will have the higher priority to be chosen. In order to overcome the problem of un-utilisation machines, sometimes faced by unreliable machine, the hybrid particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with differential evolution (DE) has been applied to balance the load for all the machines. Simulation studies show that the proposed system can be used as an effective way of choosing machines in integrated process planning and scheduling.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09511920903207472</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buinhas, Luisa</author><author>PeytavA, Graciela G.</author><author>FArstner, Roger</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Navigation and communication network for the Valles marineris explorer (VAMEX)</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>69th International Astronautical Congress: #InvolvingEveryone, IAC 2018, October 1, 2018  -  October 5, 2018</full-title></periodical><pages>Boeing; et al.; Landspace; Lockheed Martin; Northrop Grumman; UAE Space Agency</pages><volume>2018-October</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Global positioning system</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Robots</keyword><keyword>Space-based radar</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Earth (planet)</keyword><keyword>Geometrical optics</keyword><keyword>Radio navigation</keyword><keyword>Synthetic aperture radar</keyword><keyword>Radar imaging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>International Astronautical Federation, IAF</publisher><isbn>00741795</isbn><abstract>With recent advances in robotics and space technology for the exploration of our Solar System, innovative mission concepts are being proposed to further extend our knowledge of our neighbouring planets and their satellites. VaMEx, abbreviation for Valles Marineris Explorer, is an example of such an initiative. VaMEx aims to survey the canyons of the Valles Marineris valley, which spans approximately 4000 km from East to West and 7 km in depth near the Martian equator, for the duration of one year. VaMEx comprises of a swarm of multiple robotic elements: crawler robots, surface mobility rovers and aerial mobility vehicles. These users are foreseen to disperse along the Valles Marineris independently while pursuing their collaborative exploration tasks. Due to the hazardous environment, it is required that these elements navigate autonomously, broadcast position information and exchange science data during the operational phase of the mission. To support these functions, a VaMEx space segment to be located in a Mars orbit(s) is being proposed. This space segment is called the VaMEx NavComNet (Navigation and Communication Network). The NavComNet has the concrete aims of serving as a near real-time positioning system for surface, aerial and potential space-based users; serving as a science data, telemetry and telecommand relay between Earth and the in-situ users; as well as cross-communication relay between users. In order to develop a suitable concept for the VaMEx NavComNet, three possible swarm localization schemes was investigated: 1) radio positioning, 2) cartographic triangulation of ground features from optical images and 3) cartographic triangulation of radar persistent scatters. The first method, radio positioning, relies on range and Doppler shift observables of an RF signal transmitted between provider-user. A good example of such architecture are widely used Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The second method involves the detection and tracking of swarm elements by comparing topographic characteristics extracted from optical images. The third concept involves synthetic aperture radar imaging (SAR), whereby interactions with the impinging radar signal can be detected and used to triangulate the user's location. For each of the proposed navigation concepts, an optimum orbit constellation solution was assessed. Each solution was evaluated in terms of orbit stability, control effort and communications performance using metrics specific to each of the three concepts (length of pass, visibility gaps, geometry constraints, etc.). With the described navigation concept and mission analysis results, a preliminary operational architecture for the VaMEx NavComNet space segment is conceived, taking into account existing technologies, communications performance, overall mission complexity and feasibility.

First, the node structure and deployment application of WSNs are analyzed, and the architecture of UAV collaborative data collection is designed. Second, the related models of communication energy consumption between WSNs' network and UAV cluster, UAV cluster task allocation, and path planning are established successively. Then, a simple but efficient task planning strategy considering UAV forward and return distances is proposed. Finally, for the problem of model solving, the solution strategy of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed. The simulation results verify that the strategy reduces the overall network energy consumption by 42.16% and the total range of UAV by 9.7% and realizes the relative minimization of WSNs energy consumption and UAV flight cost on the premise of ensuring the full coverage of WSNs' nodes.  2001-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2022.3212785</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christensen, Fin</author><author>Kientopf, Kai</author><author>Staudinger, Emanuel</author><author>Gunes, Mesut</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance of Routing Protocols over TDMA MAC for Robotic Swarms in Space Exploration</title><tertiary-title>IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>95th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference - Spring, VTC 2022-Spring, June 19, 2022  -  June 22, 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>Huawei; Nokia; pix moving; Samsung; Technology Innovation Institute (TII)</pages><volume>2022-June</volume><keywords><keyword>Ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>IEEE Standards</keyword><keyword>Internet protocols</keyword><keyword>Routing protocols</keyword><keyword>Radio waves</keyword><keyword>Space research</keyword><keyword>Time division multiple access</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><isbn>15502252</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860797</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Future space exploration missions to celestial bodies will use a multitude of networked robots. This paper addresses the networking aspect and in particular the routing in such an ad hoc network during surface exploration. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) developed a wireless communication, localization, and timing system including a PHY and MAC for decentralized swarm communication. A decentralized routing protocol is required to realize multi-hop communication. Thus, the natural choice is an ad hoc network routing protocol. We introduce a simulation environment to study ad hoc network routing protocols for this application field. The network simulation provides a TDMA based MAC resembling DLR's system, an IEEE 802.11g MAC, and incorporates elevation data of the Moon's surface for realistic radio propagation modeling. Furthermore, we present and evaluate performance metrics relevant for planetary surface exploration.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860797</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Helsinki, Finland</custom1><custom3>95th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference - Spring, VTC 2022-Spring, June 19, 2022  -  June 22, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aydln, Esin Ece</author><author>Kara, Omer</author><author>Cakir, Furkan</author><author>Cansiz, Berna Simsek</author><author>Secinti, Gokhan</author><author>Canberk, Berk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enabling Self-Organizing TDMA Scheduling for Aerial Swarms</title><tertiary-title>DroNet 2022 - Proceedings of the 2022 8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications, Part of MobiSys 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications, DroNet 2022 - Part of MobiSys 2022, July 1, 2022</full-title></periodical><pages>13-18</pages><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Military operations</keyword><keyword>Ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Cost effectiveness</keyword><keyword>Internet protocols</keyword><keyword>Time division multiple access</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Association for Computing Machinery, Inc</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/3539493.3539584</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the proliferation of affordable VTOL drones, application domain of aerial swarms expands everyday, spanning from public drone art to offensive military operations. Orchestrating these systems towards a successful mission, especially in contested environments, requires strict synchronization and reliable communication among network entities. Although using a ground controller with a long range link provides a cost-effective solution, it is extremely vulnerable to single-point of failure and/or jamming attacks. Thus, in contested environments, adapting ad-hoc policies is one of the most promising approaches, mitigating these vulnerabilities. However, existing ad-hoc approaches fail to sustain multi-hop connections, suffering from frequent topology changes and intermittent links due to dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose self-organizing TDMA (STDMA) protocol for aerial swarms in order to ensure reliable communication through efficient network management. We also partially implement our protocol on a small-scale test-bed and show that how drones are able to self-configure upon joining the network without any prior information. Our proposed STDMA protocol improves the overall channel utilization up to 55 percent with less control traffic overhead compared to the existing studies.  2022 ACM.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3539493.3539584</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Portland, OR, United states</custom1><custom3>8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications, DroNet 2022 - Part of MobiSys 2022, July 1, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ir, Visweswaran Karunanithi</author><author>Rajan, Raj Thilak</author><author>Sundaramoorthy, Prem</author><author>Verma, Maneesh Kumar</author><author>Verhoeven, Chris</author><author>Bentum, Mark</author><author>McCune, Earl W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High data-rate inter-satellite link (ISL) for space-based interferometry</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>70th International Astronautical Congress, IAC 2019, October 21, 2019  -  October 25, 2019</full-title></periodical><volume>2019-October</volume><keywords><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Radio transceivers</keyword><keyword>Nanosatellites</keyword><keyword>Budget control</keyword><keyword>Satellite communication systems</keyword><keyword>Ionosphere</keyword><keyword>Radio astronomy</keyword><keyword>Radio interference</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>International Astronautical Federation, IAF</publisher><isbn>00741795</isbn><abstract>The inter-satellite link (ISL) in swarm and constellation missions is a key enabler in the autonomy of the mission. OLFAR (Orbiting Low Frequency Array for Radio astronomy) is one such mission where 10 to 50+ nanosatellites are placed in the Lunar orbit and perform astronomical observations from the far-side of the moon. Each of the nanosatellite in the swarm would carry a receiver that performs observations between 0.3 - 30 MHz, which are the least explored frequency bands in radio astronomy, thus attracting a large scientific interest. Observations in this frequency bands from Earth are highly challenging as the ionosphere is opaque to these frequency bands. Furthermore, RFI (Radio Frequency Interferences) generated on Earth makes it highly challenging to perform astronomical observations below 30MHz band. The impediments faced by Earth-based or near-Earth-based radio astronomy for these frequency bands is the motivation to perform measurements from the far-side of the moon. The purpose of using a swarm of nanosatellites to perform low frequency observations is to enable the realization of long observation baselines and additionally, the effective aperture of observation increases with the number of satellites. For the swarm of nanosatellites to operate as a single aperture, it is very important to cross-correlate the information collected by each satellite and this is where the ISL becomes very crucial. Apart from exchanging data collected by the payload, other information such as attitude and timing information needs to be exchanged. This work derived mission level requirements which would be used to define a suitable communication architecture for space-based radio astronomy missions such as OLFAR. The approach chosen for communication system for such a swarm mission will comprise of two types of ISL: High data-rate directional link that will be used to exchange payload date and low data-rate omni-directional link that will be used to exchange attitude, timing information and be used for localization, positioning and ranging of the nanosatellites in the swarm. This work will present link budgets to show the feasibility of the proposed communication architecture and derive the specs to further design the transceivers.

Cooperative, multiple robots are employed for many different tasks to increase the efficiency and success of a mission. However, many of the existing collective path planning approaches do not guarantee a reliable escape in environments with complex, non-convex obstacles without any prior knowledge. In this study, we developed a navigation framework for multi-robot systems in unknown areas that solely exploit the sensing information and shared data among the agents. The key contribution of this paper is the simultaneous, collision-free motion planning for fully autonomous robots in a collective manner. Furthermore, our communication architecture enables the robots to find an appropriate path to a desired, joint target position, despite the limited sensing and communication range.  2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2020.103604</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Muraleedharan, Rajani</author><author>Osadciw, Lisa Ann</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive security protocol for sensor based VANET using swarm intelligence</title><tertiary-title>Conference Record - Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>43rd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, November 1, 2009  -  November 4, 2009</full-title></periodical><pages>288-290</pages><keywords><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Intelligent systems</keyword><keyword>Network security</keyword><keyword>Intelligent vehicle highway systems</keyword><keyword>Vehicle to vehicle communications</keyword><keyword>Wireless sensor networks</keyword><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Vehicular ad hoc networks</keyword><keyword>Vehicles</keyword><keyword>Denial-of-service attack</keyword><keyword>Response time (computer systems)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><isbn>10586393</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACSSC.2009.5470101</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Intelligent Transportation system (ITS) using wireless and mobile ad-hoc sensor network has inspired many autonomous applications.

These impediments motivate centralized architectures for multi-UAV planning and coordination. The key problem stems from the need for a human to continuously monitor the UAVs' data streams. We discuss a hierarchical distributed task assignment algorithm, called the team consensus based bundle algorithm, that keeps these four impediments in check. Furthermore, a multi-socket manager (MSM) is presented, which was designed with these four impediments in mind. The MSM is an interface that allows testing of hierarchical and distributed planning architectures that keep these fours factors in check, e.g., the team consensus based bundle algorithm.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2011-1537</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>St. Louis, MO, United states</custom1><custom3>AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference and Exhibit 2011, March 29, 2011  -  March 31, 2011</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chelmins, David</author><author>Briones, Janette</author><author>Downey, Joseph</author><author>Clark, Gilbert</author><author>Gannon, Adam</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cognitive communications for NASA space systems</title><tertiary-title>IET Conference Publications</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>37th International Communications Satellite Systems Conference, ICSSC 2019, October 29, 2019  -  November 1, 2019</full-title></periodical><volume>2019</volume><keywords><keyword>Information management</keyword><keyword>Complex networks</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Cost effectiveness</keyword><keyword>Data transfer</keyword><keyword>Digital storage</keyword><keyword>Cognitive systems</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Delay tolerant networks</keyword><keyword>NASA</keyword><keyword>Spacecraft</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institution of Engineering and Technology</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1049/cp.2019.1222</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The growing complexity of spacecraft constellations, communication relay offerings, and mission architectures drives the need for the development of autonomous communication systems. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has traditionally launched single spacecraft missions that are served by the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) program. Operations on SCaN networks are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and often each asset serves a single user spacecraft at a time. Recent movement towards swarm missions could make the current approach unsustainable. Additionally, the integration of commercial communication service providers will substantially increase the data transfer options available to new missions. NASA science missions have found benefit in launching swarms of spacecraft, allowing coordinated simultaneous observations from different perspectives. Inter-spacecraft communication (mesh networking) is an enabler for this architecture, as are CubeSats that allow cost-effective provisioning of distributed mission assets. As more complex swarm missions launch, one challenge is coordinating communication within the swarm and choosing the appropriate mechanism for telemetry, tracking, control, and data services to and from Earth. Cognitive communications research conducted by SCaN aims to mitigate the increasing communication complexity for mission users by increasing the autonomy of links, networks, and service scheduling. By considering automation techniques including recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, cognitive algorithms and related approaches enable increased mission science return, improved resource utilization for service provider networks, and resiliency in unpredictable or unplanned environments. The Cognitive Communications Project at the NASA Glenn Research Center develops applications of data-driven, nondeterministic methods to improve the autonomy of space communication. The project emphasizes the development of decentralized space networks with artificial intelligence agents optimizing communication link throughput, data routing, and system-wide asset management. This chapter discusses the objectives, approaches, and opportunities of the research to address growing needs of the space communications community.  2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Such networks can be very useful in practice in applications that require fine-grain monitoring of physical environment subjected to critical conditions (such as inaccessible terrains or disaster places). Features including the huge number of sensor devices involved, the severe power, computational and memory limitations, their dense deployment and frequent failures, pose new design and implementation aspects. The efficient and robust realization of such large, highly-dynamic, complex, non-conventional, environments is a challenging algorithmic task. We here present the Forward Planning Situated Protocol (FPSP), for scalable, energy efficient and fault tolerant data propagation in situated wireless sensor networks. To deal with the increased complexity of such deeply networked sensor systems, instead of emphasizing on a particular aspect of the services provided, i.e. either for low-energy periodic, or low-latency event-driven, or high-success query-based sensing, FPSP uses two novel mechanisms that allow the network operator to adjust the performance of the protocol in terms of energy, latency and success rate on a per-task basis. We emphasize on distributedness, direct or indirect interactions among relatively simple agents, flexibility and robustness. The protocol operates by employing a series of plan &amp; forward phases through which devices self-organize into forwarding groups that propagate data over discovered paths. FPSP performs a limited number of long range, high power data transmissions to collect information regarding the neighboring devices. The acquired information, allows to plan a (parameterizable long by ) sequence of short range, low power transmissions between nearby particles, based on certain optimization criteria. All particles that decide to respond (based on local criteria) to these long range transmissions enter the forwarding phase during which information is propagated via the acquired plan. Clearly, the duration of the forwarding phases is characterized by the parameter , the transmission medium and the processing speed of the devices. In fact the parameter provides a mechanism to adjust the protocol performance in terms of the latency-energy trade-off. By reducing the latency is reduced at the cost of spending extra energy, while by increasing , the energy dissipation is reduced but the latency is increased. To control the success rate-energy trade-off, particles react locally on environment and context changes by using a set of rules that are based on response thresholds that relate individual-level plasticity with network-level resiliency, motivated by the nature-inspired method for dividing labor, a metaphor of social insect behavior for solving problems [1], Each particle has an individual response threshold that is related to the "local" density (as observed by the particle, [2]); particles engage in propagation of events when the level of the task-associated stimuli exceeds their thresholds. Let s be the intensity of a stimulus associated with a particular sensing task, set by the human authorities. We adopt the response function T(s) = sn/s n+n, the probability of performing the task as a function of s, where n 1 determines the steepness of the threshold. Thus, when is small (i.e. the network is sparse) then the response probability increases; when s increases (i.e. for critical sensing tasks) the response probability increases as well. This role-based approach where a selective number of devices do the high cost planning and the rest of the network operates in a low cost state leads to systems that have increased energy efficiency and high fault-tolerance since these long range planning phases allow to bypass obstacles (where no sensors are available) or faulty sensors (that have been disabled due to power failure or other natural events).</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1073970.1074003</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Las Vegas, NV, United states</custom1><custom3>Seventeenth Annual ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures, July 18, 2005 - July 20, 2005</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Xiangke</author><author>Liu, Zhihong</author><author>Cong, Yirui</author><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Chen, Hao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Miniature fixed-wing UAV swarms: Review and outlook</title><secondary-title>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</full-title><abbr-1>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</abbr-1></periodical><volume>41</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Fixed wings</keyword><keyword>Application programs</keyword><keyword>Command and control systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10006893</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7527/S1000-6893.2019.23732</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Focusing on the new direction of miniature fixed-wing UAV swarms, this paper summarizes their recent developments from three aspects, i.e, the connotation of the swarm system, the existing typical programs, and the key technologies.

These swarms can directly contact via ground control station or direct communication. However, when communicating remotely via wireless and fine maneuverability of the unmanned aerial vehicle, many mechanisms face several security gaps, such as the authentication mechanism in enemy attacks. In this study, we propose safe and effective authentication mechanism appropriate for the dynamic environment of the unmanned aerial vehicle. In the frames of this approach, a new operating mechanism in the proposed protocol is described. The protocol provides authentication security for swarms of the unmanned aerial vehicle.

In addition, we present the proofs that both architectures ensure the objective which is position/velocity synchronization of the robotic swarm to references determined by the human. Further analysis in differences between both architectures is then presented, by considering the same velocity command from the human operator and inspecting the visual feedbacks of each architecture. In addition, the effects on the transparency of all robots' actual trajectories to the visual feedback are also discussed.

To mitigate the effect of these failures, fault tolerance becomes imperative. Nonetheless, it remains to be a second tier activity-it should not undermine the execution of the mission oriented tasks of WSNs through overly taxing their resources. We define architecture for fault tolerance in WSNs that is based on a federation of mobile agents that is used both for diagnostic intelligence and repair regimen, focusing on being lightweight in energy, communication and resources. Mobile agents are classified here as local, metropolitan, and global, providing fault tolerance at node, network and functional levels. Interactions between mobile agents are inspired by honey bee dance language that builds on semantics of errors classification and their demographic distribution. Our quantitative modeling substantiates that the proposed fault tolerance framework mandates minimalist communication through contextualized bee-inspired interactions, achieving adaptive sensitivity, and hysteresis-based stability.  2010 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CNSR.2010.26</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Montreal, QC, Canada</custom1><custom3>8th Annual Conference on Communication Networks and Services Research, CNSR 2010, May 11, 2010  -  May 14, 2010</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jian</author><author>Liu, Yongxin</author><author>Niu, Shuteng</author><author>Jing, Weipeng</author><author>Song, Houbing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Throughput Optimization in Heterogeneous Swarms of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for Advanced Aerial Mobility</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2752-2761</pages><volume>23</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Intelligent systems</keyword><keyword>Interactive computer systems</keyword><keyword>Real time systems</keyword><keyword>Scheduling</keyword><keyword>5G mobile communication systems</keyword><keyword>Aircraft accidents</keyword><keyword>Fighter aircraft</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>15249050</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TITS.2021.3082512</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The ubiquitous deployment of 5G New Radio (5G NR) stimulates Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) swarm networking to evolve to achieve more imminent progress. The heterogeneous collaboration between UAS swarm enhances the complexity and the efficiency of mission complement that requires robustness, flexibility, and sustainability of throughput in UAS swarm networking. The conventional approaches mainly are based on the hierarchical architectures that are limited to satisfy the challenges of UAS swarm with high dynamics on a large scale. In this paper, we propose an optimal cell wall paradigm to enhance the throughput in heterogeneous UAS swarm networking. With the weight adjustment of each link, we map the optimization into a polyhedron scheduling problem and formula the problem into Max-min Throughput Fair Scheduling (MTFS). Further, we propose a max-min throughput algorithm to optimize the minimum throughput of cell wall paradigm. With the optimal max-min throughput, we optimize the schedule with edge-coloring to achieve global MTFS solving. The normalized MTFS shows our algorithm can achieve over 40% improvement of MTFS globally. In terms of MTFS solving, our algorithms have promising potential to improve the throughput and mitigate the incidents for multiple beams enabling of UAS in cell wall communication. With the throughput enhancement, the advanced aerial mobility of UAS swarm networking can be escalated on a large scale.  2000-2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2021.3082512</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Si-Wei</author><author>Chen, Jing</author><author>Shen, Lin-Cheng</author><author>Tao, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECNP-based method of distributed dynamic task allocation for multiple observation satellite planning</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings - 2nd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computer Control, ICACC 2010</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - 2nd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computer Control, ICACC 2010</full-title></periodical><pages>325-328</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICACC.2010.5486945</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A extended contract net protocol(ECNP) is introduced to solve the dynamic task allocation for multiple satellites collaborative planning system(MSCPS) in which the environment and capabilities of each Agent can dynamically change with time.

These bodies may also one day serve as resource restocking de-pots for longer duration missions. However, in-situ scientific analysis requires the development of microgravity-tolerant landers that are not subject to recoil on impact. Whereas prior art focuses primarily on anchoring and hopping mechanisms, this paper evaluates a novel mission architecture in which chains of bistable pinching elements called grapplers are used to land net-like infrastructure on low gravity bodies. Unlike single-point-of-contact landers, a net that is successfully adhered to an asteroid may serve broad and flexible use in the exploration of small bodies. For example, it may constitute infrastructure to enable locomotion of a swarm of distributed crawling sensors and actuators for high resolution study of the bodys interior structure and surface properties. It may also serve as a foundation onto which larger scale sensing and communication structures can be built over time. Finally, it may serve as a series of hand holds used by astronauts to maneuver around the body. To adhere the net to a body, microgravity flight testing of a representative Grappler prototype demonstrates the tolerance of a bistable chain to variable impact conditions and terrain contours owing to the inherent adaptivity of the chains pinching configuration-for a chain of n bistable elements, 2n pinching configurations are possible. These pinching elements can be integrated sparsely or densely into net-like infrastructure. A computational model is also presented. Grapplers are compared to alternative net adhesion strategies ranging from passive wrapping to chemical rigidization.  2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

As a critical component of an aviation swarm, airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communication capability. Considering the deficiencies of today's ATNs, it is unable to meet the communication demands of an aviation swarm, which motivates us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm and design a SDN-enabled airborne tactical network (SD-ATN). For the SDN paradigm, network monitoring information (M-info) is the source of knowledge that forms the globe network view of the control plane; therefore, how to ensure that the control plane collects M-info from the data plane in a reliable and real-time way is a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN. To address this issue, a transmission framework called the MCF-SD-ATN is first designed, which makes it practical to provide dedicated quality of service (QoS) guarantees for the M-info collection. Then, a communication protocol called the MCP-SD-ATN is designed to implement the M-info collection work based on the MCF-SD-ATN. We implement the MCF-SD-ATN and the MCP-SD-ATN in EXata 5.1 for simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is appropriate for M-info collection in the SD-ATN.  2018 Kefan Chen et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/1940842</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zipfel, Peter H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CADAC: Multi-use Architecture for Constructive Aerospace Simulations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation</abbr-1></periodical><pages>129-145</pages><volume>9</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Flight simulators</keyword><keyword>Data handling</keyword><keyword>Computer aided design</keyword><keyword>Degrees of freedom (mechanics)</keyword><keyword>Fighter aircraft</keyword><keyword>Computer software</keyword><keyword>C++ (programming language)</keyword><keyword>Object oriented programming</keyword><keyword>Studios</keyword><keyword>Supersonic aircraft</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>15485129</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1548512910395641</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In today's network-centric world, aerospace vehicles interact with many objects. They navigate by overhead satellites, synchronize their flight paths with other vehicles, swarm over hostile territory and attack multiple targets. Studying these engagements with high-fidelity constructive simulations has become an important task of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). The simulation framework Computer Aided Design of Aerospace Concepts (CADAC) has its roots in FORTRAN code that dates back to the 1960s and was used by industry and the U.S. Air Force to simulate aerospace vehicles in all flight environments. To adapt CADAC to the new environment, a complete rewrite was carried out in C++, taking advantage of object-oriented programming techniques. The architecture of CADAC++ is based on the hierarchical structure of inherited classes. The vehicles (aircraft, missiles, satellites or ground targets), inherit the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) equations of motion from the classes 'Flat6' or 'Round6', conveying either the flat or elliptical Earth model. In turn, these classes inherit the communication structure from the base class 'Cadac'. The components of the vehicle, e.g., aerodynamics, propulsion and autopilot, are represented by modules, which are member functions of the vehicle class. Communication among the modules occurs by protected module-variable arrays. Every instantiated vehicle object is encapsulated with its methods and data. To communicate between vehicles, data packets are loaded onto a global data bus for recall by other vehicles. Input occurs by ASCII file and output is compatible with CADAC Studio, a plotting and data processing package. CADAC++ is chiefly an engineering tool for refining the components of the primary vehicle and exploring its performance as it interacts (possibly repeatedly instantiated) with the multi-object environment. Its modular structure enables reuse of component models across simulations. In the 10 years of development, CADAC++ based constructive simulations have been built for many types of aerospace vehicles and integrated with mission-level simulations. 2012 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1548512910395641</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Virbora, Ny</author><author>Sokoeun, Un</author><author>Saran, Meas</author><author>Sovicheyratana, Sous</author><author>Channareth, Srun</author><author>Saravuth, Srim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Implementation of Matrix Drone Show Using Automatic Path Generator with DJI Tello Drones</title><tertiary-title>8th International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies, ICEET 2022</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>8th International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies, ICEET 2022, October 27, 2022  -  October 28, 2022</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>IEEE Standards</keyword><keyword>Wireless local area networks (WLAN)</keyword><keyword>Wi-Fi</keyword><keyword>Medium access control</keyword><keyword>High level languages</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICEET56468.2022.10007090</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper described the process of designing and applying 100 DJI Tello EDU drones to display various characters following from A to Z and 0 to 9 as letters and words. The drones are divided into four groups, each of 25 drones. Each drone is connected to a wireless access point where the mission control center operates the command to each drone individually in parallel to display the expected letter or words. Python is the programming language used for commanding and controlling the operation. The communication between drones and the mission control computer is done wirelessly with Wi-FiS02.11N technology running at a 2. 4GHz frequency. Each drone is assigned to a specific IP address as an ID based on the unique Media Access Control (MAC) address. To communicate with the drones, the User Diagram Protocol (UDP) protocol is used for the communication. As a result, the matrix drone can perform different flights showing different characters and words including various custom 3D shapes.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEET56468.2022.10007090</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</custom1><custom3>8th International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies, ICEET 2022, October 27, 2022  -  October 28, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baiocchi, Andrea</author><author>Turcanu, Ion</author><author>Vinel, Alexey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Age of Information in CSMA-Based Networks With Bursty Update Traffic</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>44088-44105</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Probability distributions</keyword><keyword>Embedded systems</keyword><keyword>Industrial robots</keyword><keyword>Markov processes</keyword><keyword>Cyber Physical System</keyword><keyword>Mobile agents</keyword><keyword>Asymptotic analysis</keyword><keyword>Carrier communication</keyword><keyword>Carrier sense multiple access</keyword><keyword>Machine-to-machine communication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>21693536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168321</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Exchanging status information between closely located mobile agents is an underlying process in numerous future Cyber Physical System (CPS). Real-time updates including positions of neighboring nodes is performed when, for example, autonomous vehicles execute a cooperative maneuver, industrial robots collaborate with each other on a task, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) execute a mission in a swarm. For the design of networked automatic control strategies in these scenarios, it is essential to understand the performance of such Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications from the information freshness perspective. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework which allows characterizing the Age of Information (AoI) in networks governed by the Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol. Differently from existing work, we take into account the fact that update packets sent by mobile nodes are not necessarily periodic, since packet triggering is often coupled with agents' mobility. Our approach is based on the assumption that diverse mobility-triggered message generation patterns can be modeled by a wide class of update traffic arrival processes. We apply Discrete Markovian Arrival Process (DMAP), which is a versatile arrival model able to fit arrival patterns that are modulated by a finite state machine, including bursty traffic. We develop an accurate and efficient analytical model of nodes exchanging one-hop broadcast update messages with bursty arrivals to evaluate the moments as well as entire probability distribution of several performance metrics, including AoI. An asymptotic analysis for large networks suggests a simple way to control the update message rate to minimize the AoI. We show that the optimal update rate that minimizes the mean AoI coincides with the optimum of the wireless channel utilization. Numerical examples point out that the asymptotic theory provides accurate predictions also for small values of the number of nodes.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168321</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbera, S.</author><author>Stallo, C.</author><author>Savarese, G.</author><author>Ruggieri, M.</author><author>Cacucci, S.</author><author>Fedi, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system for hazardous applications</title><tertiary-title>UKSim2010 - UKSim 12th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>12th UKSim International Conference on Modelling and Simulation, UKSim 2010, March 24, 2010  -  March 26, 2010</full-title></periodical><pages>104-109</pages><keywords><keyword>Global positioning system</keyword><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Application programs</keyword><keyword>Hazards</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword><keyword>Microcontrollers</keyword><keyword>Mobile agents</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/UKSIM.2010.27</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The evolution of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) systems capabilities will result in more increasing autonomy and mobility of ICT devices.

Device swarms are smart, mobile, and interconnected devices that operate in large numbers and are likely to be part of emerging applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). Swarm devices process and exchange safety, privacy, and mission-critical information. Thus, it is important to have a good code verification technique that scales to device swarms and establishes trust among collaborating devices. DADS has several advantages over current state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques: It is decentralized, has no single point of failure, and can handle changing topologies after nodes are compromised. DADS assures system resilience to node compromise/failure while guaranteeing only devices that execute genuine code remain part of the group. We conduct performance measurements of communication, computation, memory, and energy using the TrustLite embedded systems architecture in OMNeT++ simulation environment. We show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce communication cost and is very efficient in terms of computation, memory, and energy requirements. We also analyze security and show that DADS is very effective and robust against various attacks.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3325822</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leitgeb, E.</author><author>Zettl, K.</author><author>Muhammad, S.

UAVs should collect data for a defined area with a variety of sensors. When these UAVs are operating in swarm formation, the observation area could be increased and it would also be possible to deal with a loss of a UAV. The big amount of data produced by the UAVs requires high date rate connectivity, therefore the free space optical (FSO) communication is suitable. When using FSO links some important issues need be considered, the beam attenuation due the atmosphere on one side and the alignment of the FSO units on the other side. The alignment raises technical challenges in tracking and acquisition. The combination of UAVs with the FSO communication is an interesting investigative scenario and some of the important aspects of this ambitious design are the main focus of this paper. 2007 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2007.4296268</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Rome, Italy</custom1><custom3>2007 9th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks, ICTON 2007, July 1, 2007  -  July 5, 2007</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Yi</author><author>Yao, Dan-Ya</author><author>Li, Li</author><author>Pei, Hua-Xin</author><author>Yan, Song</author><author>Ge, Jing-Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Technologies and Applications for Intelligent Vehicle-infrastructure Cooperation Systems</title><secondary-title>Jiaotong Yunshu Xitong Gongcheng Yu Xinxi/Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Jiaotong Yunshu Xitong Gongcheng Yu Xinxi/Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology</full-title><abbr-1>Jiaotong Yunshu Xitong Gongcheng Yu Xinxi/Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>40-51</pages><volume>21</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Intelligent systems</keyword><keyword>Intelligent vehicle highway systems</keyword><keyword>Energy utilization</keyword><keyword>Energy efficiency</keyword><keyword>Motor transportation</keyword><keyword>Highway administration</keyword><keyword>Integration testing</keyword><keyword>Highway planning</keyword><keyword>Roads and streets</keyword><keyword>Systems engineering</keyword><keyword>Security of data</keyword><keyword>Road vehicles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10096744</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.16097/j.cnki.1009-6744.2021.05.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Intelligent Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaboration Systems (i-VICS) represent the cutting-edge technology and an inevitable trend in the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) globally. It is critically developed to improve travel efficiency, optimize energy consumption, and reduce vehicle emissions, and will fundamentally change the management mode of traditional road transportation. Firstly, i-VICS is introduced in the paper as the common platform for future road traffic systems. Based on it, the change of service domains for the user services in the national architecture of ITS is discussed. The latest related technologies are then investigated for the implementation of i-VICS, including technologies for multimode wireless communication, intelligent networking, information security, and system integration, and also for the application of i- VICS, including technologies to support the collaborative perception, swarm coordinated decision-making and control, simulation-testing validation, and connected automated driving. With the consideration of the long- term development of i- VICS, the contents of implementation, degree for information sharing and synergistic functions that could be realized in different stages are presented. Furthermore, concerning the challenge from its implementation and application, the paper points out that to obtain deep understanding, to grasp the essence, promote the experience and moderate scale of application for i-VICS can effectively address the development of modern intelligent transportation system. In short, the fundamental theoretical research, key technology development and practical system application of i- VICS will play an important role in ITS and related disciplines, like systems engineering for transportation and science for systems.

Autonomy is a critical need for these systems, since the cost associated with applying conventional approaches for command and control does not scale with the number of spacecraft. Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy (DSA) is a project developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that enables distributed spacecraft systems through the development of three capabilities: scalable communication, distributed coordination and planning, and human-swarm interaction. DSA will demonstrate these capabilities in two contexts. The first context is a flight demonstration consisting of a software payload hosted on the Starling-1 small-spacecraft mission. This software payload will use the on-board GPS receiver to perform in-situ, swarm-level reconfiguration in response to observed features in the Topside Ionosphere. The second context is a scalability study, which shows how the technologies developed in the flight demonstration can scale to a large number of spacecraft ( 100). The scalability demonstration applies the tools developed for the flight mission to a hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the flight software payload.  2020 The MITRE Corporation.

Swarm intelligent systems are not only efficient at solving group-level problems, but also decentralized, controllable by few simple parameters, making possible the command and control of UAV swarms by a single operator. Four separate but related projects are surveyed that explore the command and control of UAV swarms. Each project employs the DDDAS paradigm, entailing the ability of an executing application to incorporate dynamic data into the decision process, and conversely, to steer the measurement process via a central application system. By providing an overview of DDDAS approaches to UAV swarm mission scheduling, UAV swarm communication, UAV swarm formation planning, and flocking applications, general principles of UAV swarms and DDDAS architecture may be observed.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2013.6721531</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Washington, DC, United states</custom1><custom3>2013 43rd Winter Simulation Conference - Simulation: Making Decisions in a Complex World, WSC 2013, December 8, 2013  -  December 11, 2013</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daniel, Kai</author><author>Dusza, Bjoern</author><author>Lewandowski, Andreas</author><author>Wietfeld, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Airshield: A system-of-systems muav remote sensing architecture for disaster response</title><tertiary-title>2009 IEEE International Systems Conference Proceedings</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2009 IEEE International Systems Conference, March 23, 2009  -  March 26, 2009</full-title></periodical><pages>196-200</pages><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>System of systems</keyword><keyword>Nuclear weapons</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SYSTEMS.2009.4815797</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For clarification, containment and combat of large danger areas, fast and flexible survey of potentially contaminated areas is an emerging challenge. In this paper we present a project that focuses on incidents, that are caused by uncontrolled emissions of liquid or gaseous contaminants (e.g. explosive or toxic gases or liquids, biological, chemical or nuclear weapons). Instead of sending specially equipped forces with expensive transport and measurement devices into the contaminated area, our proposed system makes use of an autonomous, wireless connected swarm of Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAV), often simply known as drones, that are featured with lightweight mobile sensor systems. In this paper we will be particularly focusing on the complex communication system, which on the one hand has to organize the on-board-communication between the control systems of the MUAV and the sensors and on the other hand has to establish wireless connections to the mission control center on the ground as well as to neighboring MUAVs in the air via a mesh network.  2009 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SYSTEMS.2009.4815797</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Vancouver, BC, Canada</custom1><custom3>2009 IEEE International Systems Conference, March 23, 2009  -  March 26, 2009</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soumya, J.</author><author>Tiwary, Srijan</author><author>Chattopadhyay, Santanu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Area-performance trade-off in floorplan generation of Application-Specific Network-on-Chip with soft cores</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Systems Architecture</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>61</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Energy utilization</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Economic and social effects</keyword><keyword>Distributed computer systems</keyword><keyword>Integrated circuit design</keyword><keyword>Network-on-chip</keyword><keyword>Programmable logic controllers</keyword><keyword>Routers</keyword><keyword>Servers</keyword><keyword>Aspect ratio</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>13837621</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.sysarc.2014.11.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Application-Specific Network-on-Chip (ASNoC) synthesis has found increasing significance in developing System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions for applications. This paper integrates various issues in the ASNoC synthesis process - availability of soft cores (with area and aspect ratio regulations), floorplanning for the whole NoC and determining router locations. Apart from attaching primary routers to the cores, it also introduces necessary extra secondary routers, so that the inter-router link length can be kept within a specified upper bound. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based formulation has been made to solve this integrated problem with a trade-off between the overall chip-area and the network communication overhead. Experimentation has been carried out with a set of well-known benchmarks. Apart from static communication cost, throughput, latency and energy consumption of the approach have been computed. The approach compares favourably with some recent approaches reported in the literature.  2014 Elsevier B.V.

To handle mobility, the MWSN node should be much more efficient than the nodes in static WSN. Moreover, a MWSN node should be capable of handling real time mobility control, path planning and navigation. The application domains of MWSN can be further expanded by incorporating swarm like intelligence in MWSN. We have developed a low cost, small form factor hardware platform which will function as a node in MWSN using custom off the shelf(COTS) products. Our mobile hardware platform, henceforth called as BSwarm robot supports self-assembly, to achieve complex tasks. The platform also support image assisted navigation and provides extensive I/O support for further feature expansion. The testbed consisting of multiple BSwarm robot can be utilized for the development and validation of algorithms/protocols related to MWSNs, distributed control of Swarm robots, real time image processing etc. BSwarm robot is a multi processor based robot designed in such a way that it can be used for applications which may demand varied degree of processing, communication and input-output capabilities. This paper also highlights major factors that can be taken into consideration while choosing the hardware platform for MWSNs so that the protocol stack development for MWSNs becomes easier.  2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SPICES.2015.7091533</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Calicut, India</custom1><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems, SPICES 2015, February 19, 2015  -  February 21, 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gul, Faiza</author><author>Mir, Adnan</author><author>Mir, Imran</author><author>Mir, Suleman</author><author>Islaam, Tauqeer Ul</author><author>Abualigah, Laith</author><author>Forestiero, Agostino</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Centralized Strategy for Multi-Agent Exploration</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>126871-126884</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Industrial robots</keyword><keyword>Multipurpose robots</keyword><keyword>Intelligent robots</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword><keyword>Space research</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>21693536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3218653</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper introduces recently developed Aquila Optimization Algorithm specifically configured for Multi-Robot space exploration. The proposed hybrid framework 'Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration Aquila Optimizer' (CME-AO) is a unique combination of both deterministic Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration (CME) and a swarm based methodology, known as Aquila Optimizer (AO). A novel parallel communication protocol is also embedded to improve multi-robot space exploration process while simultaneously minimizing both the computation complexity and time. This ensures acquisition of a optimal collision-free path in a barrier-filled environment via generating a finite map. The architecture starts by determining the cost and utility values of neighbouring cells around the robot using deterministic CME. Aquila Optimization technique is then incorporated to increase the overall solution accuracy. Numerous simulations under different environmental conditions were then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Algorithm consistency aspects in achieving the expected results (area explored rate and time) is demonstrated through statistical means. A perspective analysis is then performed by comparing the performance of the CME-AO algorithm with latest state of art contemporary algorithms namely conventional CME and CME-WO (CME Whale Optimizer). The comparison duly accommodates all pertinent aspects such as % area explored, number of failed runs, and time taken for map exploration for different environments. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents two distinct advantages over the other conventional state of the art CME based techniques a) enhanced map exploration in cluttered environment and b) significantly reduced computation complexity and execution time, with almost no fail runs. This makes the suggested methodology particularly suitable for on-board utilization in an obstacle-cluttered environment, where other techniques either fails (stuck locally) or takes longer exploration time.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3218653</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Sung-Chan</author><author>Ahn, Il-Yeop</author><author>Park, Jong-Hong</author><author>Kim, Jaeho</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards real-time data delivery in oneM2M platform for UAV management system</title><tertiary-title>ICEIC 2019 - International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019  -  January 25, 2019</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Information management</keyword><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Command and control systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.23919/ELINFOCOM.2019.8706417</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents oneM2M standard platform architecture design and its implementation which supports real-time data delivery for UAV management system. Recently, a UAV swarm service is getting a lot of attention since compared to the single UAV, a UAV swarm can reduce time of executing various mission activities such as remote sensing, surveillance, search and rescue. However, to support those UAV swarm service scenarios, UAV management system should be involved and moreover, the system requires a real-time data delivery feature due to the high cruise speed of the UAVs and the low-latency constraints of the command and control message. Considering oneM2M message flows, we have designed the procedure which enables real-time data delivery in oneM2M platform and experimental results show that our system improves end-to-end delay performance in various network environments.  2019 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers (IEIE).</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/ELINFOCOM.2019.8706417</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Auckland, New zealand</custom1><custom3>18th International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication, ICEIC 2019, January 22, 2019  -  January 25, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dunbar, Thomas W.</author><author>Esposito, Joel M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Artificial potential field controllers for robust communications in a network of swarm robots</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the Annual Southeastern Symposium on System Theory</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</full-title></periodical><pages>401-405</pages><volume>37</volume><keywords><keyword>Reliability</keyword><keyword>Robots</keyword><keyword>Redundancy</keyword><keyword>Robustness (control systems)</keyword><keyword>Systems engineering</keyword><keyword>Wireless telecommunication systems</keyword><keyword>Motion control</keyword><keyword>Telecommunication networks</keyword><keyword>Control equipment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/SSST.2005.1460945</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An active area of research in the robotics community is "swarm control," where many simple robots work together to execute tasks which are beyond the capability of any single robot acting alone. Yet in order for the swarm members to work together effectively they must maintain a reliable and robust wireless communication network among them. The goal of this project is to investigate motion control laws which fulfill the dual and sometimes conflicting requirements of executing a primary mission (e.g. search and rescue) while maintaining a robust mobile wireless communication network among the swarm members. Three different spatial requirements for robust communication are considered in this project: proximity, line of sight and redundancy. To this end, several artificial potential fields have been developed and simulated to determine their success in controlling the swarm. The strengths and weaknesses, the design process and the interaction of the controllers constitute the heart of the paper. At a higher level, we address the challenge of how to compose these motion control laws to achieve the primary mission in a meaningful way.  2005 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SSST.2005.1460945</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Tuskegee, AL, United states</custom1><custom3>37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kloetzer, Marius</author><author>Belta, Calin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal logic planning and control of robotic swarms by hierarchical abstractions</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Robotics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Robotics</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Transactions on Robotics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>320-330</pages><volume>23</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Control systems</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robotics</keyword><keyword>Collision avoidance</keyword><keyword>Model checking</keyword><keyword>Mobile robots</keyword><keyword>Temporal logic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>15523098</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TRO.2006.889492</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We develop a hierarchical framework for planning and control of arbitrarily large groups (swarms) of fully actuated robots with polyhedral velocity bounds moving in polygonal environments with polygonal obstacles. At the first level of hierarchy, we aggregate the high-dimensional control system of the swarm into a small-dimensional control system capturing its essential features. These features describe the position of the swarm in the world and its size. At the second level, we reduce the problem of controlling the essential features of the swarm to a model-checking problem. In the obtained hierarchical framework, high-level specifications given in natural language, such as linear temporal logic formulas over linear predicates in the essential features, are automatically mapped to provably correct robot control laws. For the particular case of an abstraction based on centroid and variance, we show that swarm cohesion, interrobot collision avoidance, and environment containment can also be specified and automatically guaranteed in our framework.

Compared with the past, people's pursuit of spiritual and cultural life also makes our education field usher in a huge development to adapt to the changes in the context of the times. But, at the same time, the development of labor education is gradually being downplayed by people, resulting in a series of problems such as people preferring comfort and not working. Aiming at this common problem, this paper will use the ant colony algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm in the computer intelligent algorithm to optimize the way of labor education. It includes the principle and basic process of the ant colony algorithm, the establishment of the mathematical model of the original ant colony algorithm, and the improved algorithm of the ant colony algorithm. The research results of the optimization method of labor education showed the following: when the number of ant colonies reaches 51, the number of iterations of the algorithm will be the least, and the corresponding shortest path is also the best solution; when the combination of pheromone intensity and volatility factor is 3, the optimal solution can be quickly found, and the algorithm inflection point of MMAS is 44.82. From the research results, it can be seen that the computer intelligent algorithm has a good choice for the optimization of labor education and can achieve a major breakthrough in the traditional model of labor education.  2022 Liming Huang et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/8740978</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Liping</author><author>Zhao, Ruichuan</author><author>Wu, Wenzheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Based on Improved Artificial Neural Network Sewage Monitoring Alarm System Method</title><secondary-title>Scientific Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Programming</full-title><abbr-1>Scientific Programming</abbr-1></periodical><volume>2022</volume><keywords><keyword>Monitoring</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>MATLAB</keyword><keyword>Optimal control systems</keyword><keyword>C (programming language)</keyword><keyword>Target tracking</keyword><keyword>Water quality</keyword><keyword>Biochemical oxygen demand</keyword><keyword>Dissolution</keyword><keyword>Dissolved oxygen</keyword><keyword>Effluent treatment</keyword><keyword>Effluents</keyword><keyword>Sewage</keyword><keyword>Water pollution</keyword><keyword>Water pollution control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10589244</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2022/6397478</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sewage discharge has become a key issue affecting the quality of the water environment, and how to effectively monitor and manage sewage discharge behavior has become a key factor to avoid water pollution and improve water quality. However, the current domestic sewage discharge monitoring system is not perfect, resulting in the lack of effective monitoring of enterprise sewage discharge by regulatory authorities, which provides an opportunity for enterprises to steal discharge. In the background of sewage treatment plant, the comprehensive design of sewage monitoring and alarm system is carried out based on the idea of physical information fusion. The design adopts a four-layer information physical architecture, which is divided into four parts: perception communication, fusion processing, push, and execution. In the fusion treatment part, the neural network intelligent algorithm is used to predict the dissolved oxygen, and the oxygen delivery is adjusted according to the predicted value to achieve accurate aeration and optimize the effluent quality. The push and execution parts adopt multiparameter monitoring to realize the smooth operation of equipment and ensure the system security. A new optimal control strategy of dissolved oxygen based on neural network is proposed. Through a large number of experiments and historical data, the intake index and dissolved oxygen value of the aeration tank under the condition of optimal outlet water are obtained as samples. According to the sample training, the BP neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to achieve accurate prediction of dissolved oxygen under different inlet water conditions. The smooth operation of sewage treatment equipment is accomplished by the lower machine and the upper machine. In sewage treatment, each process section collects the equipment status in strict accordance with the order of sewage monitoring facilities. Then the communication network between the upper computer and the lower computer and the sensor is designed. The lower machine adopts PLC as the core, programming PLC through STEP7, and uses PID algorithm to control dissolved oxygen. The PC is developed in C language, so as to realize user login, real-time data display, over-limit fault alarm, report query, user management, etc. The PC integrates MATLAB neural network on the platform to predict dissolved oxygen through mixed programming quantity. The sewage alarm system based on improved artificial neural network is sensitive and has excellent performance. It provides a new idea for intelligent sewage detection and real-time monitoring.  2022 Liping Chen et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6397478</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kratzke, Nane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Smuggling multi-cloud support into cloud-native applications using elastic container platforms</title><tertiary-title>CLOSER 2017 - Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science, CLOSER 2017, April 24, 2017  -  April 26, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>29-42</pages><keywords><keyword>Containers</keyword><keyword>Process control</keyword><keyword>Cloud computing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>SciTePress</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5220/0006230700570070</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Elastic container platforms (like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos) fit very well with existing cloudnative application architecture approaches. So it is more than astonishing, that these already existing and open source available elastic platforms are not considered more consequently in multi-cloud research. Elastic container platforms provide inherent multi-cloud support that can be easily accessed. We present a solution proposal of a control process which is able to scale (and migrate as a side effect) elastic container platforms across different public and private cloud-service providers. This control loop can be used in an execution phase of self-Adaptive auto-scaling MAPE loops (monitoring, analysis, planning, execution). Additionally, we present several lessons learned from our prototype implementation which might be of general interest for researchers and practitioners. For instance, to describe only the intended state of an elastic platform and let a single control process take care to reach this intended state is far less complex than to define plenty of specific and necessary multi-cloud aware workflows to deploy, migrate, terminate, scale up and scale down elastic platforms or applications. 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Resilience of traditional monolithic spacecraft is achieved mainly through redundancy, which exponentially increases the complexity of their production, and therefore, their cost. One solution would be to use fragmented spacecraft systems. Redundancy is achieved by nature with local complexity. Furthermore, scalability of such a system is facilitated. However, data transfer and physical communication link between the 'fragments' must be addressed. The main challenge of these systems is the management of the network of satellites. Traditional centralised networks, managed by a single entity, have been proven not to be secure, as they generate a common point of failure, susceptible to attacks. Traditional distributed networks, managed by multiple entities, require honest participants and trust between entities, restricting collaborative mission applications. In the present article, a design for a blockchain-enabled swarm fractionated system managed by multiple trustless entities is proposed. The system is composed of functionally different nano-satellites which perform tasks from different subsystems in order to replicate the functionalities of a monolithic spacecraft. The blockchain nodes are deployed in the satellites and allow sharing of sensor data between the network. A consensus protocol ensures the validity of the shared data. The proposed system has been implemented and evaluated on a local blockchain composed of four Ethereum nodes. We believe that the proposed application opens the way to new collaborative missions between entirely trustless parties, ensuring transparency and cooperation within the system.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843336</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Big Sky, MT, United states</custom1><custom3>2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2022, March 5, 2022  -  March 12, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reynaud, Laurent</author><author>Guerin-Lassous, Isabelle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design of a force-based controlled mobility on aerial vehicles for pest management</title><secondary-title>Ad Hoc Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ad Hoc Networks</full-title><abbr-1>Ad Hoc Networks</abbr-1></periodical><pages>41-52</pages><volume>53</volume><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Aircraft control</keyword><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Micro air vehicle (MAV)</keyword><keyword>Bacteriology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>15708705</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.adhoc.2016.09.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Vespa velutina, also known as the Asian hornet, is considered as an invasive species out of its native zone. In particular, since it preys on honey bees, its recent progression in Europe could soon pose a significant risk to the local apiculture activity. European beekeepers are therefore investigating adapted control strategies, including V. velutina nest destruction. Unfortunately, nest location pinpointing generally follows a manual process which can prove tedious, time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose the use of a network of micro aerial vehicles featuring autonomous and cooperative flight capabilities. We describe an adapted controlled mobility strategy and detail the design of our Virtual Force Protocol (VFP) which allows a swarm of vehicles to track and follow hornets to their nests, while maintaining connectivity through a wireless multi-hop communication route with a remote ground station used to store applicative data such as hornet trajectory and vehicle telemetry. In order to achieve the mission objectives with a minimum of vehicles, we identify through simulations appropriate value for the key parameters of VFP and discuss the obtained network performance.  2016 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2016.09.005</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kretzer, Manuel</author><author>In, Jessica</author><author>Letkemann, Joel</author><author>Jaskiewicz, Tomasz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resinance: A (smaRt) material ecology</title><tertiary-title>ACADIA 2013: Adaptive Architecture - Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>33rd Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Adaptive Architecture, ACADIA 2013, October 21, 2013  -  October 27, 2013</full-title></periodical><pages>137-146</pages><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Computer aided design</keyword><keyword>Distributed computer systems</keyword><keyword>Resins</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>ACADIA</publisher><abstract>What if we had materials that werent solid and static like traditional building materials are?

Swarm technologies [11] use context-awareness in short-haul networks between components, and long-distance networks allow communication with Earth. However, the propagation delays limit real-time communications, deep space being an environment in which the speed of light becomes a restriction. Therefore, the development of a protocol stack which is adaptive to application requirements and external influences will help to maximise communication synchronicity. As part of a first year doctorate research programme, this paper correlates current stack functionalities with interplanetary application requirements. A redesigned stack proposes to resolve this misalignment Context-awareness is incorporated, enabling intelligent protocol selection using application layer knowledge and environmental information, with particular attention given to transport protocols. The paper concludes by considering transport protocol characteristics when deployed beside a context-aware layer, with the longterm aim being the development of a transport protocol suitable for deployment in the state-of-the-art context-aware stack.  2006 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICAS.2006.27</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>San Jose, CA, United states</custom1><custom3>2006 International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems, ICAS'06, July 20, 2006  -  July 21, 2006</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Velazco, Jose E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Omnidirectional Optical Communicator</title><tertiary-title>IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2019, March 2, 2019  -  March 9, 2019</full-title></periodical><volume>2019-March</volume><keywords><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Budget control</keyword><keyword>Optical communication</keyword><keyword>Bandwidth</keyword><keyword>Spacecraft</keyword><keyword>Mirrors</keyword><keyword>Optical links</keyword><keyword>Photodiodes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><isbn>1095323X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/AERO.2019.8741924</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We are developing an inter-satellite omnidirectional optical communicator (ISOC) that will enable cross-link communications between spacecraft at Gbps data rates over distances of up to thousands of kilometers in free space. The ISOC will allow superfast cross-links and will be a technology enabler for swarms and formation flying spacecraft. The ISOC under development features a truncated dodecahedron geometry that can hold an array of fast photodiode detectors and gimbal-less MEMS scanning mirrors. The main goals of the ISOC development include: 1) full sky coverage, 2) Gbps data rates and 3) the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous links. We have developed two omnidirectional communicator prototypes capable of full-duplex operation. We are using advanced single-mode laser diodes operating at 850 nm capable of producing hundreds of milliwatts of laser radiation. We are also employing MEMS-based beam steering mirrors, and fast PIN photodiodes to achieve long-range communications. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve full duplex operation at 1 Gbps data rates over 200 km and slightly lower data rates at longer distances. In this paper we describe the overall ISOC architecture and present the design tradeoffs for gigabit data-rate operation. We also present preliminary NRZ On-Off Keying communications simulation results obtained using our optical link budget model. The ISOC is ideally suited for crosslink communications among small spacecraft, especially for those forming a swarm and/or a constellation. Small spacecraft furnished with ISOC communications systems, should be able to communicate at gigabit per second rates over long distances. This data rate enhancement can allow real-time, global science measurements and/or ultra-high fidelity observations from tens or hundreds of Earth-orbiting satellites, or permit high-bandwidth, direct-to-earth communications for planetary missions.  2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2019.8741924</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Big Sky, MT, United states</custom1><custom3>2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2019, March 2, 2019  -  March 9, 2019</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bramanti, Cristina</author><author>Izzo, Dario</author><author>Llorens, Jose</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coherently cooperating satellite swarms for autonomous in-orbit operations</title><tertiary-title>International Astronautical Federation - 58th International Astronautical Congress 2007</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>58th International Astronautical Congress 2007, September 24, 2007  -  September 28, 2007</full-title></periodical><pages>6264-6265</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Robotics</keyword><keyword>NASA</keyword><keyword>Space-based radar</keyword><keyword>Systems analysis</keyword><keyword>Interplanetary spacecraft</keyword><keyword>Earth (planet)</keyword><keyword>Lunar missions</keyword><keyword>Spacecraft propulsion</keyword><keyword>Synthetic aperture radar</keyword><keyword>Self assembly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>International Astronautical Federation, IAF</publisher><abstract>Recent trends in the space community for smaller, cheaper and more frequent space missions are driving the development of nano- and pico-spacecraft, which are considered for large constellations or swarm formations. In particular, the payload is distributed over multiple satellites belonging to the same mission. Swarms of separated elements cooperating coherently can be used to perform simultaneous scientific measurements of the space environment or implemented as large virtual, sparse apertures in space for high-resolution radar imagery of Earth, interferometry and high gain communications. Advantages of distributed constellations of micro-satellites over traditional single-satellite deployments include increased performance, redundancy and the possibility of reducing the overall cost, in term of launch cost and mission recovery by the substitution of a failed component. These improvements make the implementation of these swarm systems attractive as the functionality is spread over a number of cooperating satellites, thus enabling new missions which would not be possible with a single satellite. The challenges in controlling singularly a large number of elements are, though, enormous: the autonomy of the whole swarm is thus necessary. Swarm- intelligence is the scientific discipline that is expected to give an answer to this technological challenge. Multi-robot autonomous planetary exploration, on-orbit self-assembly, multiple coordinated observations (sensor-webs), are just examples of what could be achieved by the development of a flexible, robust, decentralised, and self-organized system exploiting collective emerging behaviours. The use of swarm robotics is also relevant for advanced mission architectures such as those recently studied by ESA (APIES mission) and NASA (ANTS mission) making use of satellite swarms to explore the asteroid belt or planetary surfaces. In the present paper we present the system design of a single collaborative -satellite swarm component and we analyse the various subsystems including power, propulsion, communication and the relative/absolute position sensors. We give a number of design options for the swarm element, associated to different performance levels, weights and dimensions. Possible in-orbit operations of the pico-satellite swarm architecture are then evaluated based on the Delta-V and the communications/sensing capabilities obtained as a result of the spacecraft system design. In particular, the operational phase is studied relying upon novel techniques based on swarm intelligence and behavioural robotics. These help to cope with the limited capabilities of a swarm element and thus to reach the required global swarm behaviour. Starting from the results achieved during the swarm element design and the in-orbit dynamical simulations, we critically argue on the feasibility of a number of applications recently proposed for in-orbit swarms.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>Hyderabad, India</custom1><custom3>58th International Astronautical Congress 2007, September 24, 2007  -  September 28, 2007</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Xiaoyan</author><author>Liu, Tianyi</author><author>Liu, Song</author><author>Kacimi, Rahim</author><author>Dhaou, Riadh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Priority-based data collection for UAV-aided mobile sensor network</title><secondary-title>Sensors (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sensors (Switzerland)</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors (Switzerland)</abbr-1></periodical><volume>20</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Antennas</keyword><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Data acquisition</keyword><keyword>Sensor nodes</keyword><keyword>Network topology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>14248220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s20113034</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this work, we study data collection in multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The network topology is changing due to the mobility of the UAVs and the sensor nodes, so the design of efficient data collection protocols is a major concern. We address such high dynamic network and propose two mechanisms: prioritized-based contact-duration frame selection mechanism (PCdFS), and prioritized-based multiple contact-duration frame selection mechanisms (PMCdFS) to build collision-free scheduling and balance the nodes between the multi-UAV respectively. Based on the two mechanisms, we proposed a Balance algorithm to conduct the collision-free communication between the mobile nodes and the multi-UAVs. Two key design ideas for a Balance algorithm are: (a) no need of higher priority for those nodes that have lower transmission rate between them and the UAV and (b) improve the communication opportunity for those nodes that have shorter contact duration with the UAVs. We demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms through extensive simulations, and real experiments.

One of the important factors to ensure the collaboration among swarm UAVs is the reliable, high performance wireless communication links among UAVs. Because of its high frequency efficiency and high performance, OFDM based multi-carrier transmission technology has been considered one of the strong candidates for swarm UAV communications. However, UAV communication links are quite different from Wireless LAN and Wireless MAN environments where OFDM is currently used. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the BER performance of IEEE 802.11a compatible OFDM system in a UAV wireless communication channel where a large Doppler shift has been observed and where Inter-Carrier-Interference (ICI) is much larger than those of Wireless LAN and Wireless MAN scenarios.  2005 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SSST.2005.1460867</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Tuskegee, AL, United states</custom1><custom3>37th Southeastern Symposium on System Theory, SST05, March 20, 2004 - March 22, 2004</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hu, Xiaojian</author><author>Jiang, Jun</author><author>Lu, Jian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distributed regional traffic signal control model for high-density network</title><tertiary-title>Proceedings of the 2010 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication, ICFCC 2010</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 2010 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication, ICFCC 2010</full-title></periodical><pages>V2145-V2149</pages><volume>2</volume><keywords><keyword>Network architecture</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Distributed computer systems</keyword><keyword>Traffic control</keyword><keyword>Travel time</keyword><keyword>Delay control systems</keyword><keyword>Traffic signals</keyword><keyword>Goal programming</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497360</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A distributed regional traffic signal control method for the high-density network is proposed according to the characteristics of the high-density network. The method adopts the distributed architecture to improve the effectiveness of system optimization and the stability of system operation, which is suitable for the high-density network where the distribution of intersections is dense and traffic flow varies frequently. The method takes travel time delay and average queue ratio as the optimal objectives to build the traffic signal optimal model based on cell transmission model, and employs the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm and goal programming principles to optimize the traffic control parameters of the intersections.

The overall cost (including price, weight, energy, etc.) of the payload required by some missions is sometimes too important to enable the robots of the swarm to embed all the required capabilities (i.e., sensors and actuators). This is the reason why it is more suitable to spread all the capabilities among the robots of the swarm. In this case, it is necessary to implement a collaborative system inside the swarm in order to share the capabilities among them. This collaborative system should provide task allocation as well as management of conflicts and failures which can occur at any moment. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative system for heterogeneous swarms of autonomous mobile robots called AMiRALE (Asynchronous Missions Relay for Autonomous and Lively Entities). Our system if fully distributed and relies only on asynchronous communications. We provide a formal description of our proposal based on a graph relabeling system. We also present experimental results obtained through both simulation and emulation. Our evaluation is based on a park cleaning scenario which relies on autonomous and specialized ground robots.  2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NOTERE.2015.7293473</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Paris, France</custom1><custom3>International Conference on Protocol Engineering, ICPE 2015 and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems, NTDS 2015, July 22, 2015  -  July 24, 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Kefan</author><author>Lv, Na</author><author>Zhao, Shanghong</author><author>Wang, Xiang</author><author>Zhao, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A scheme for improving the communications efficiency between the control plane and data plane of the SDN-Enabled airborne tactical network</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>37286-37301</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Efficiency</keyword><keyword>Software defined networking</keyword><keyword>Military communications</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>21693536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852707</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the battlefield becoming more challenging, the aviation swarm is considered a promising organization of air combat forces to execute both combat and non-combat air missions. As a critical component of the aviation swarm, the airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communications capability, enabling information sharing between both manned and unmanned military aircrafts as well as surface and ground platforms. The deficiencies of legacy ATNs, particularly their inability to meet the communications demands of the aviation swarm, motivated us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm to the ATN and to design an SDN-enabled ATN (SD-ATN) for the aviation swarm. For the SDN paradigm, the communications efficiency between the control plane and the data plane directly impacts the normal operations of the network, raising a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN, which is that how to ensure the QoS requirements of the non-elastic information transmitted between the control plane and the data plane (non-elastic C/D information) is met. To address this issue, a transmission framework is first proposed to make it practical to provide dedicated QoS guarantee for the non-elastic C/D information. Then, a communication protocol is designed based on the proposed framework, aiming at transmitting the non-elastic C/D information in a reliable and real-time manner. The simulation results show that, in the aviation environment, our scheme does improve the transmission efficiency of the non-elastic C/D information, which performs better than legacy solutions.  2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852707</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kong, Dong-Uck</author><author>An, Jinung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modular behavior controller for underwater robot teams: A biologically inspired concept for advanced tasks</title><tertiary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>4th International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Applications, ICIRA 2011, December 6, 2011  -  December 8, 2011</full-title></periodical><pages>536-547</pages><volume>7102 LNAI</volume><keywords><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Controllers</keyword><keyword>Intelligent robots</keyword><keyword>Knowledge based systems</keyword><keyword>Dolphins (structures)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer Verlag</publisher><isbn>03029743</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-642-25489-5_52</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In ambition to give subaqueous robot groups more robustness and behavioral flexibility for real applications, this paper proposes a modularized behavior control architecture. Schools of naval mammals provide the proof that also individual members of the group can achieve higher leveled intelligence independent of the simplicity of their collective behavior. Due to their structurally and functionally modularized brain organization, dolphins are capable of language based communication and learning complex motions by human training. Inspired by dolphins, 3 modules for the behavior controller can be conceptualized. The swarming module optimized by evolutionary methods represents the basic behavior given in the natural environment. The mission module includes extendable sets of behavior primitives that can be structured by reinforcement learning. A knowledge based sensing module can be implemented separately to increase the information reliability. With this approach, subaqueous robot schools can be expected to perform more advanced tasks than just moving as a swarm.  2011 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25489-5_52</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Aachen, Germany</custom1><custom3>4th International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Applications, ICIRA 2011, December 6, 2011  -  December 8, 2011</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giordano, Pietro</author><author>Zoccarato, Paolo</author><author>Otten, Michiel</author><author>Crisci, Massimo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>P2OD: Real-time precise onboard orbit determination for LEO satellites</title><tertiary-title>30th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2017</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>30th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2017, September 25, 2017  -  September 29, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>1754-1771</pages><volume>3</volume><keywords><keyword>Global positioning system</keyword><keyword>Manned space flight</keyword><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Signal receivers</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Velocity</keyword><keyword>Space rendezvous</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Institute of Navigation</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.33012/2017.15190</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Satellite orbit determination is a fundamental information for many space missions, several requiring a high level of orbit accuracy. Nowadays the Precise Orbit Determination (POD) is the technique routinely used on ground for computing the orbit of LEO missions, especially when the position of the satellite center of mass has to be known at cm level (e.g.: GRAS, Sentinels, SWARM, GOCE, etc.). The current POD approach must be performed only on ground in post-processing. The orbit accuracy achieved with the POD is typically between 0.1 mm/s to 1 mm/s for the velocity. Despite being in line with mission needs, the post-processing limitation is preventing its use for more advanced applications that require high accuracy in real-time, such as formation flying, autonomous docking and rendezvous, increased spacecraft autonomy, etc. This contribution investigates how to overcome the real-time limitations and shows that real-time Precise Onboard Orbit Determination (P2OD) could be achieved in the near future, bringing the current ground PPP (Precise Point Positioning) and PPP-RTK (Precise Point Positioning -Real Time Kinematic) concept to space users. The target real-time orbit accuracy to be achieved with this approach is 10 cm RMS 3D (1 mm/s for velocity). Different algorithms have already been developed for onboard orbit determination, ranging from a least square approach to Extended or Unscented Kalman Filtering (EKF, UKF). Usually the initial position is provided through a Single Point Positioning (SPP) technique, using only the pseudorange measurements. The SPP solution can be smoothed by fitting a dynamic model. These onboard algorithms allow to reach an orbital velocity accuracy (3D RMS) at m/s or cm/s level ([23], [24], [25], [26] and [27]). Several studies ([28], [29] and [30]) have also investigated the optimization of the force models acting on the satellites and the related parameters for propagating the orbit with the electronics onboard a LEO satellite. The main limitation for such onboard OD algorithms is the lack of precise ephemeris and clock products for the GNSS satellites in real-time. GNSS receivers in space can use techniques and concepts adoptable by GNSS receiver on ground. There are at least two main concepts for real-time high accuracy positioning computation based on GNSS: RTK and PPP. RTK relies on use of ground stations in the proximity of the user receiver, therefore cannot be considered viable from space users. PPP (and its evolution, the PPP-RTK) is based on the broadcast of precise corrections (mainly precise orbits and clocks, but also a precise ionospheric model and, for PPP-RTK, delta phase correction for performing Integer Ambiguity Resolution on the rover) through different communication channels (e.g., via geostationary satellites, GSM, Internet). This study addresses two main types of communication channels for providing precise orbit and clock corrections of the GNSS satellites: the dedicated broadcast and the global broadcast channels. The dedicated broadcast channel assumes that each GNSS satellite (e.g.: GPS or Galileo) broadcasts its own precise corrections for orbits and clocks. Such a condition could be achieved with an improvement of the current broadcasted ephemerides and clocks (via standard navigation message) or via a dedicated communication channel provided by the GNSS satellites that goes on top of the broadcasted navigation message. In this scenario the available bandwidth is normally limited, so the amount of corrections that can be disseminated is limited (allowing to transmit only the corrections for the satellite itself or a small group of nearby satellites) and there is a need for a constant communication contact from the uplink stations to all or a high number of the GNSS satellites. Modern GNSS systems are very close to provide the infrastructure to enable the dedicated broadcast scheme and the present study aims to propose potential strategies to overcome the current limitations. The global broadcast channel relies on geostationary satellites for disseminating the precise corrections for all the GNSS satellites at the same time. Two major cases are considered: SBAS and commercial PPP providers. SBAS is planned to achieve worldwide coverage by 2020, but the dissemination of precise corrections to achieve cm level accuracy is today outside the scope of such systems, mainly because providing the integrity for such an accuracy might be not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, a new service providing high accuracy corrections (initially without integrity) could be implemented using a potentially available spare bandwidth in the SBAS. Nowadays, commercial geostationary satellites are the only way to achieve the dissemination of precise corrections, using commercial PPP service providers that currently cover the entire globe. This work will analyze the implications of using such communication channels on the space receiver architecture. The adopted solution will be suitable for different types of 24h 3-axis stabilized LEO spacecraft, from nano-satellites to large Earth-observing satellites. A novel concept based on the use of multi-antennas will be proposed to overcome the weak communication links above the poles for receiving the corrections from geostationary satellites. The real-time precise orbit determination will be sequentially computed with an EKF-based OD algorithm. The approach will be validated using real data from flying missions. Finally, a potential roadmap for In-Orbit Demonstration (IOD) will be presented.  2017 Institute of Navigation.

This article looks at the emergent properties of the system as a whole based on local spacecraft behaviors, and how these behaviors can be adjusted to achieve mission goals. The significance of this approach is that it frees the ground station from the micromanagement of individual spacecraft (despite the lack of intersatellite links) which is a crucial requirement for the feasibility of future cluster/swarm missions. To understand the system fully, an analysis is presented for simple systems that have different characteristics. Performance is evaluated in terms of intuitive behaviors (greedy, considerate, proactive, and obstinate) that are mathematically defined. This reveals that performance can be steadily improved by making the behaviors more "self-aware." Simulations are then extended to swarms involving larger numbers of spacecraft to demonstrate scalability and more realistic scenarios for practicality.The final contribution of thiswork is to introduce various mechanisms for supervisors, and/or the ground station, to dynamically adjust behavior to achieve load balancing across the cluster.

For this purpose we introduce the concept of mobile relay stations, which form a chain between the base station and the explorer and forward all communication. In order to cope with the mobility of the explorer, relay stations must adapt their positions. We investigate strategies which allow the relay stations to self-organize in order to maintain a chain of small length. For a plane without obstacles, the optimal positions are on a line connecting the base station with the explorer; in a setting with obstacles it is a curve around some of the obstacles. Our goal is to keep the relay stations as close to this line/curve as possible. A crucial requirement for strategies is that they are able to work with imprecise or without localization and odometry information. Furthermore, strategies should be local, i.e., relay stations should not need to know about the state of the system as a whole. The performance measures for strategies are the number of relay stations used (in comparision to the optimal number) and the allowed speed of the explorer (in comparision to its maximum attainable speed). We contribute by analyzing the performance of an already known strategy Go-To-The-Middle. This strategy assumes a very weak robot model and needs hardly any localization information, but sacrifices perfomance. Our main contribution is a new strategy, the Chase-Explorer strategy, and its analysis. It needs more advanced robots than Go-To-The-Middle, but achieves near-optimal performance. We further extend it to exploring terrains with obstacles.

At the heart of this vision, cascading unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) into a "SWARM" of connectivity nodes offers great flexibility and modularity. The USVs must be able to provide a network of communication data relays, a common tactical picture and mapping for situational awareness. The vehicles must also possess robust communications resistant to jamming, fading and interference while acquiring a high speed data exchange for processing and fusion of information. Reliable wireless network with high data throughput is essential in various military wireless communication systems. While the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication schemes have the potential to exceed the single-input single-output (SISO) Shannon capacity bound, equipping a large number of antennas in a USV is practically impossible. To increase the diversity gain beyond the number of physical antennas, cooperative wireless networks that exploit cooperation among multiple terminals become essential. This paper proposes novel cooperative wireless networking schemes and practical coding designs that provide the USV Swarm reliable wireless links with the overall data throughput and the communication quality significantly exceeding those of the existing non-cooperative systems.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>Anaheim, CA, United states</custom1><custom3>AUVSI's Unmanned Systems North America 2004 - Proceedings, August 3, 2004 - August 5, 2004</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Atkinson, Michele L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contract nets for control of distributed agents in unmanned air vehicles</title><tertiary-title>2nd AIAA "Unmanned Unlimited" Conference and Workshop and Exhibit</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2nd AIAA "Unmanned Unlimited" Conference and Workshop and Exhibit 2003, September 15, 2003  -  September 18, 2003</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Multi agent systems</keyword><keyword>Intelligent agents</keyword><keyword>Fighter aircraft</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>AIAA International</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2514/6.2003-6532</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This research evaluates several approaches to coordinating multiple agents hosted on a flight of unmanned air vehicles for use in Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) strike missions.

Within the workstation a complex adaptive system models the dynamic formation of collection teams while evolutionary algorithms, operating at the agent level, attempt to optimize the global performance of the ISR family of systems by modifying the various agent's responsiveness to attributes of the 'support requests'. Joint MEASURE, a DEVS based Monte Carlo mission effectiveness simulator developed by Lockheed Martin, provides the infrastructure for this workstation enabling the unpredictability of scenario evolution to be an integral element of the optimized solution. An overview of the architecture is provided along with sample results and lessons learned.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>San Diego, CA, United states</custom1><custom3>1st DEVS Integrative M and S Symposium, DEVS 2005, Part of the 2005 Spring Simulation Multiconference, SpringSim 2005, April 3, 2005  -  April 7, 2005</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Masehian, Ellips</author><author>Royan, Mitra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new model for solving the simultaneous object collecting and shepherding problem in flocking robots</title><tertiary-title>IJCCI 2012 - Proceedings of the 4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, IJCCI 2012, October 5, 2012  -  October 7, 2012</full-title></periodical><pages>96-105</pages><keywords><keyword>Decision making</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Fuzzy inference</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>SciTePress</publisher><abstract>Shepherding behavior is a class of collective behaviors in flocking systems which requires that a swarm of mobile robots enter an area populated with known or unknown obstacles, collect a flock of static or dynamic particles (objects), and guide them safely to a predefined goal position. Applications of this behavior are in sheep or duck shepherding and fishing. In this paper, a new algorithmic model is developed for online formation control, decision making, behavior selection, and motion planning of a team of homogeneous and anonymous (no leader and follower) flocking robots which simultaneously perform object collecting and shepherding tasks. The model's architecture is enriched with various complex flocking actions such as flock deformation, flock split and merge, flock expansion, and flock obstacle avoidance. Contributions of this paper include (i) defining a new class of problems for flocking robots called Simultaneous Object Collecting and Shepherding (SOCS) problem, (ii) incorporating online obstacle sensing and avoidance methods in the flocking behavior, and (iii) developing a fuzzy expert system for determining the strategy of environment exploration. The fuzzy inference engine provides an effective way to minimize the time spent on collecting objects while maximizing the gain obtained by object collection, in a way that the flock's formation and integrity is maintained. The proposed model was implemented on a number of simulations and produced rational and satisfactory results.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><custom1>Barcelona, Spain</custom1><custom3>4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, IJCCI 2012, October 5, 2012  -  October 7, 2012</custom3></record></records></xml>
