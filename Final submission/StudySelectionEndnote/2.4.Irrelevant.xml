This is trending in different satellite industry applications such as Earth observation and satellite communication as it is simple, cheap and increases the system robustness. Multi-satellite missions introduced different lines of development like constellations, trail formation and swarm formations to fit different type of missions requirements. Inspired by the Space Ultra-Low Frequency Radio Observatory (SULFRO) project, based on the concept of a constellation of a micro-satellite mothership and 12 nano-satellite daughters, designed for sky observation and space discovery, in this paper, we propose a model of decentralized swarm formation without using a centralized coordination. The proposed method is based on the assumption that micro-satellite share relative position of the formation and communicate through high speed inter-satellite link. Assuming a 2D space for the micro-satellite formation and deployment, the proposed methodology succeeded to deploy the 12 micro-satellites in their targeted formation. The proposed methodology consists of three states that are: Formation Tracking, Movement Control and Collision Avoidance. These three states contributed in the success of the methodology by ensuring that the micro-satellite share the positions and track the new formation needed to ensure the stability and safety of the micro-satellite swarm. The paper also investigated the power consumption of the system and the system stability. The proposed methodology is simulated in three different validation scenarios and successfully achieved the required formation.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Robotic and Sensors Environments (ROSE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Robotic and Sensors Environments (ROSE)</research-notes><custom3>2022 IEEE International Symposium on Robotic and Sensors Environments (ROSE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The main drawback of naturally inspired strategies, such as Levy flight, is the agents' poor coordination and redundant search (continuous exploration of single location within minimum time and space). The redundant search was removed by assigning probability values to cells and subjecting agents' waypoints acceptance to distance and time threshold. The proposed algorithm ensures broad coverage, minimised redundant search, scalability, and adaptable swarm coordination. The benefits of the algorithm were evaluated on the simulation of the Nigerian telecommunication masts surveillance mission using a proposed architecture. Future work focuses attention on the implementation of algorithms on real drones and sensor information organisations.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 1st International Conference on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Applied Science (ICMEAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 1st International Conference on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Applied Science (ICMEAS)</research-notes><custom3>2021 1st International Conference on Multidisciplinary Engineering and Applied Science (ICMEAS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.

Though individual UAVs are extremely useful entities, their productivity can further be increased by deploying multi-UAVs. Pattern formation among multi-UAVs is one of the key functionalities in a swarm environment that is essential for several UAV missions namely military expedition, search and rescue operations, drone based delivery mechanisms etc. In this paper, to facilitate pattern formation among UAVs in an effective manner, a Time-Interleaved Pattern Formation (TIPF) Mechanism is proposed. The existing systems work for a fixed number of drones whose pattern switching mechanisms are preprogrammed. However, the TIPF mechanism enables switching patterns among dynamic number of drones (UAVs) on the fly by inducing a small delay between each UAV movement. The TIPF mechanism avoids collision, which occurs due to the simultaneous movement of UAVs. The proposed TIPF mechanism encompasses a Centralised Coordinate Calculation (CCC) algorithm to easily calculate the coordinates of UAVs in a given pattern. Further, this mechanism has also been simulated and tested in our proposed virtual IP based Software In The Loop (V-SITL) environment. This proposed V-SITL environment offers increased scalability on account of the entire UAV system being simulated in a single computer. The TIPF mechanism has been simulated for 8 drones in a dynamic manner for square and triangle patterns. The simulation results show that the pattern formation time avoids collision in a time interleaving rate of 52.63%.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference</research-notes><custom3>GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D. -Y.

In particular, with a limited number of UAVs, it is important to determine both mission assignment of UAVs to enhance mission performance and locations of UAVs to maintain good communication with the ground control station (GCS). In this paper, we study a problem of joint mission assignment and location management for UAVs, with jointly considering communication and mission performance. To solve the problem, employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in part, we develop an heuristic algorithm that assigns multiple UAVs to multiple missions and finds locations of all UAVs together to maximize the weighted sum of the communication and mission performance. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm provides a good solution.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)</research-notes><custom3>2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. In this talk an introduction to unmanned aerial vehicles will be made, detailing their operation, main uses, and main research challenges. Next, different applications and systems developed in our research group will be discussed, showing how wireless communications can be used to achieve advanced features such as swarm creation and collision avoidance.Regarding collision avoidance, the Mission Based Collision Avoidance Protocol (MBCAP) is presented. MBCAP is a novel UAV collision avoidance protocol applicable to all types of multicopters flying autonomously. It relies on wireless communications in order to detect nearby UAVs, and to negotiate the procedure to avoid any potential collision. Experiments show that MBCAP is very effective at impeding collisions, while introducing a flight time overhead that is typically in the range from 15 to 40 seconds.Concerning swarm creation, the Mission-based UAV Swarm Coordination Protocol (MUSCOP) is presented. It allows multiple UAVs to perfectly coordinate their flight when performing planned missions. Experimental results show that the proposed protocol is able to achieve a high degree of swarm cohesion independently of the swarm formation adopted, being resilient to channel losses, and introducing a low synchronization time overhead.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 Second International Conference on Embedded &amp; Distributed Systems (EDiS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 Second International Conference on Embedded &amp; Distributed Systems (EDiS)</research-notes><custom3>2020 Second International Conference on Embedded &amp; Distributed Systems (EDiS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V. -A.

How to do rescue mission planning for UAV swarms underlimited communication has become a difficult problem. This paperproposes a motif-based mission planning model which generates amission planning strategy as a task priority execution order isinputted. The choice of mission planning strategy turns to be thechoice of a task priority execution order which is a many-objectiveoptimization problem. Permutation and combination of task priorityexecution order contribute to the generation of mass feasible task planningstrategies. The increase in the number of tasks leads to the explosionof the amount of calculation. We enhance preference-inspiredco-evolutionary algorithm with goal vectors (PICEA-g) by usingthe K-means clustering method in the step of offspring selection to selectout next-generation goal vectors. The proposed algorithm, calledk-PICEA-g is applied in the optimization processminimizing, simultaneously, the mission completion time, the total number of changed connections, and the averagenumber of used UAVs through changing the priority execution order oftasks. As an example of application, we apply the improvedPICEA-g to optimize the execution order of a set of tasks,achieving a set of non-dominated solutions from which the decisionmaker can select the most adequate one. By experiments, thefeasibility and effectiveness of this algorithm are validated.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W. -P.

A total of ten (10) terminals were structured. Stochastic analysis of the scheme's impact with anticipated estimations of its inherent network variation challenges within the confined spectrum-sharing zone is conducted and mitigated. We then introduced four (4) novel GUEs-BSs terminal communication protocols to orchestrate communication among the deployed component terminals. The four communication protocols are the single-hop (direct), the multihop, the selective-decode-and-forward (SDP), and the incremental-decode-and-forward (IDF) protocol models. The proposed multi-UAV uplink-downlink (UL-DL) model is later deployed into direct-dense and relay-dense network environments to ascertain its robustness. As depicted, the model's performance evaluation validates antenna gain, low transmission power and improved normalized throughput in both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ICT CONVERGENCE (ICTC 2021): BEYOND THE PANDEMIC ERA WITH ICT CONVERGENCE INNOVATION&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ICT CONVERGENCE (ICTC 2021): BEYOND THE PANDEMIC ERA WITH ICT CONVERGENCE INNOVATION</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ICT CONVERGENCE (ICTC 2021): BEYOND THE PANDEMIC ERA WITH ICT CONVERGENCE INNOVATION</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.  © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 54; Correspondence Address: H.

The network lifetime is restricted to the lifetime of mesh networks of routers that are scattered across a complex disaster environment. We consider the problem of multi-UAVs relaying and moving with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime. UAVs must learn where to move in order to relay messages from the routers efficiently. However, under the dynamics of the router traffic, that is, the uncertainty of the environment, it is challenging for UAVs to find a movement mechanism that maximizes the network lifetime. By embracing the on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm Sarsa, we are able to demonstrate a greedy movement policy. Specifically, we study the trajectory planning of multiple UAVs in a dense wireless router mesh networks (WMNs) on the ground. UAVs can learn the unknown environment by a little movement of UAVs in each step, in which communication connections between routers with UAVs are retained. A Q-table of movement actions and environment states is formed after multiple attempts of movements. Simulation results show the proposal effectiveness comparing with other methods.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)</research-notes><custom3>2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as a rosy technology in the fifth generation (5G) and future mobile communication systems, has been widely studied because of its ability in improving spectral efficiency and reducing transmission latency to enhance the overall Quality of Service (QoS) and meet the strict communication requirements. Based on these, in this article, we propose a device-to-device (D2D)-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture, in which D2D is introduced to increase the file dispatching efficiency. In our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network, the ground users (GUEs) that have already received file blocks (FBs) are allowed to reuse the time-frequency resources assigned to NOMA links to share their FBs with other GUEs, which significantly improves the efficiency of file dispatching. But this also leads to a complicated interference environment. In order to effectively manage the interference and minimize the UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time, we propose a graph-based file dispatching (GFD) protocol, in which the complicated joint optimization problem is decomposed to be solved efficiently and graph theory-based algorithms are proposed for resource allocation. The simulation results verify the advantages of our proposed D2D-enhanced UAV-NOMA network architecture and the efficiency of our designed GFD protocol in minimizing the total UAV-assisted file dispatching mission time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Mission-critical applications are becoming a vital category of future IoT applications, and due to the advancements in the 5G, the design of mission-critical application overcome a big hurdle. Mission-critical applications must be reliable, and the output should be known in advance. Therefore, to model such application, architecture is considered the cornerstone. One of the major requirements is the flexibility of the operation and the adaptability to new devices. In this paper, an optimal orchestration mechanism is proposed to automate the processes in a conventional multi-device and multi-task mission-critical architecture for flexible and scalable operations. The central goal of this paper is to threefold; first, to model tasks in such a way to maximize the flexibility in the operation plane. Secondly, to design a strongly correlated pair which has maximum relation and thus the chance to hit the task on the devices will be potentially maximized and also the idle time among operations is minimal. Lastly, to register devices in a network which is optimal for the group of this device in terms of correlation. We propose a multi-layer particle swarm optimization for each of the optimization objectives. Results show that the operation plan is flexible and with scaling up the problem size, the orchestration is still graceful and within the requirements of mission-critical applications. The performance of multi-level particle swarm optimization is compared with conventional single-level particle swarm optimization and it has been learned that the later is not only slower but also less accurate. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: D.

Swarm of UAVs can be deployed in a multitude of 24/7 security and surveillance. The network management and pattern formation are crucial for multi-UAV formation control mechanisms while cautiously navigating the surveillance areas. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based Formation Flight Control for Navigation (FFCN) is used to efficiently build the UAV swarm, which decreases networking load by minimizing communication and processing involved in pattern formation. Moreover, through the leader-follower navigation, the network management of the swarm is substantially simplified. The leader-follower approach in FFCN is efficient for multi-UAV as the navigation system needs to find only the leader's trajectory. However, the failure of the leader due to actuator faults decreases the efficiency of the system. The proposed FFCN addresses the above by including a fault-tolerance mechanism, thus improving the system's reliability. Simulation results show that the FFCN model achieves faster convergence in less time with a lower collision rate. The model's usage reduced the collision rate to 3.4% in successful formation without colliding with other UAVs.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)</research-notes><custom3>2021 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

Swarm technologies by D'Arrigo, P, Santandrea, S. (2005) use context-awareness in short-haul networks between components, and long-distance networks allow communication with Earth. However, the propagation delays limit real-time communications, deep space being an environment in which the speed of light becomes a restriction. Therefore, the development of a protocol stack which is adaptive to application requirements and external influences will help to maximise communication synchronicity. As part of a first year doctorate research programme, this paper correlates current stack functionalities with interplanetary application requirements. A redesigned stack proposes to resolve this misalignment. Context-awareness is incorporated, enabling intelligent protocol selection using application layer knowledge and environmental information, with particular attention given to transport protocols. The paper concludes by considering transport protocol characteristics when deployed beside a context-aware layer, with the long-term aim being the development of a transport protocol suitable for deployment in the state-of-the-art context-aware stack</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: C.

Current timing synchronization methods focus on enhancing single-hop skews which remarkably improve timing synchronization precision at this level. The improper clock of the drone system can cause interference, affect spectrum precision and interrupt the operation of the transceiver. In the drones’ network, master drones’ (MD) neighbor drone’s timing synchronization approaches like Reference Broadcast System (RBS) realize a good performance. However, the requirement of one super drone with a large number of broadcasts for RBS makes it unrealistic to use in some situations like SDN network situation. Appropriate study and adjustments are needed to have real timing synchronization by eliminating the clocks drift and enhancing the timing synchronization precision. Therefore, a new self-timing synchronization approach is proposed in this paper where several MD drones can autonomously generate swarm clusters. The cluster head (CH) instigates a timing synchronization procedure starting with intra-Swarm cluster timing synchronization. The intermediate drones (ID) are elected between two swarm clusters to synchronize all drones in line with the inter-swarm cluster timing synchronization approach. The proposed approach is distributed and flexible to achieve high timing synchronization precision. The paper proposes a novel self-timing synchronization approach for in large scale semi-flat SND network architecture. Self-timing synchronization is swarm cluster-based and applicable for a huge number of master drones in SDN. One is the intra-Swarm cluster where the timing synchronization procedure starts with the CH to synchronize all CM. Secondly, in the inter-swarm cluster timing synchronization, two clusters are synchronized via intermediate drone (ID). However, the simulations demonstrated that in many cases all CHs are synchronized by the synchronized CHs from intra-swarm cluster timing synchronizations; this increased the system throughput and synchronization delay to about 75% compared to what we planned to achieve. Moreover, the simulation results also proved that the achieved synchronization precision can be used for position estimation and prediction with high accuracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.

It is our thesis that drone swarms can be used to communicate information enriched with effects via nonverbal channels: guiding, generally interacting with, or warning a human audience via their pattern of motions or behavior. And furthermore that this approach has unique advantages such as flexibility and mobility over other forms of user interface.In this paper, we present a user study to understand how human participants perceived and interpreted swarm behaviors of micro-drone Crazyflie quadcopters flying three different flight formations to bridge the psychological gap between front-end technologies (drones) and the human observers' emotional perceptions. We ask the question whether a human observer would in fact consider a swarm of drones in their immediate vicinity to be nonthreatening enough to be a vehicle for communication, and whether a human would intuit some communication from the swarm behavior, despite the lack of verbal or written language.Our results show that there is statistically significant support for the thesis that a human participant is open to interpreting the motion of drones as having intent and to potentially interpret their motion as communication. This supports the potential use of drone swarms as a communication resource, emergency guidance situations, policing of public events, tour guidance, etc.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems (ICHMS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems (ICHMS)</research-notes><custom3>2020 IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems (ICHMS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas. © 1998-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1491</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971556355&amp;doi=10.1109%2fCOMST.2015.2495297&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b590a744882db05fef403c95a2ed3d8f</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2495297</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The ISOC has the potential to enable up to 1 Gbps data rates over a distance up to 200 km in free space. Key features of the ISOC include full sky coverage and the ability to maintain multiple links simultaneously. The Q4 mission consists of (4) 6U CubeSats furnished with ISOCs to demonstrate high data rate communications among the spacecraft. More specifically, we seek to demonstrate the omnidirectionality of the ISOC by providing simultaneous optical links between one spacecraft and the other three. Q4 will be a demonstrator for small spacecraft swarm capabilities. Following a proposed deployment from the ISS, the CubeSats will utilize their onboard thrusters to enter their desired orbit. The orbit consists of one 'leader' spacecraft in a circular orbit with a 400 km LEO altitude and three 'follower' spacecraft in slightly elliptical orbits rotating azimuthally about the leader. The main mission will consist of three consecutive phases: First, the spacecraft will demonstrate pointing, acquisition, and tracking using newly developed protocols. Next, link establishment and different channel access methods (CDMA and TDMA) will be tested. Finally, Delay Tolerant Network protocols will be implemented to allow fast data sharing among the spacecraft. The distance between the communicating spacecraft will be increased as the mission progresses to characterize the link quality as a function of distance. All communications over the course of the mission will be recorded and analyzed on the ground using bit error rate as a metric for success. The current design for each the four Q4 CubeSats contains an XACT advanced ADCS system for precision beam pointing. Other components currently under consideration include MiPS cold gas thrusters for orbital maneuvering and gimbaled eHaWK 84W solar arrays. In this paper we present design considerations for the Q4 CubeSats, link budget calculations, results from preliminary mission analysis, and expected results. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020; Conference date: 7 March 2020 through 14 March 2020; Conference code: 162583&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Aerosp.

UAV's observation range and communication methods between UAVs have a significant impact on multi-UAV collaboration strategy. For this purpose, we study the multi-UAV observation range dynamic control method and the optimal inter-UAV communication method. Our approach is to design a multi-UAV joint observation, communication, policy, and service collaboration protocol and study the optimization method of the protocol. We propose an expert-guided deep reinforcement learning framework to optimize this protocol. Each UAV's optimal radar observation range and inter-UAV communication method are learned using an information entropy value decomposition method. Through our observation and communication method, multi-UAV are able to obtain the most valuable information. Experiments demonstrate that our method can improve MEC's service coverage by 9.38%-21.88% compared to the classical MARL algorithm. Our method improves the radar observation efficiency and communication efficiency by 3.05%-38.9% and 8.55%-22.03%, respectively. The results show that this method improves multi-UAV energy utilization. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

Sensed observations are to be delivered to an earth station either directly or through geo-stationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite relays with minimal delay. A cognitive cooperative data scheduling (CCDS) protocol is proposed for spacecrafts to leverage node cooperation and deep learning predictions to fully utilize available link capacities in order to minimize data delivery delay. Either periodically, or on an event-driven basis, each satellite predicts its expected sensing data payload and the link capacities to both Earth and GEO stations. Each spacecraft implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) that continuously learns from observed data to predict the amount of expected data over the scheduling horizon. Nodes with extra link capacity than anticipated data, called the relay nodes, broadcast their availability to act as relays to those with more expected data than their link capacities (called the source nodes). Based on neighbor requests, each relay node computes a data acceptance schedule to minimize the overall data delivery delay of the swarm. During the execution phase, source nodes forward their data to the relay nodes over the satellite crosslinks who then forward their payloads to the desired destination. Performance evaluations on a simulated system based on low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite clusters show the promise of the proposed cognitive cooperative data scheduling protocol to significantly reduce the overall data delivery delay of the swarm and to improve utilization of available link capacities. This CCDS protocol can easily be adapted for swarms of small spacecrafts deployed to the Moon, Mars, near-Earth objects (NEOs), and other distant locations for remote sensing missions.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2021; Conference date: 21 June 2021 through 23 June 2021; Conference code: 171613&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAAW)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2021, June 21, 2021 - June 23, 2021&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Cogn.

UAVs have the potential to be employed in public space for pur- poses like surveillance, monitoring, package delivery, emergency services, etc. For proper operation, an efficient path planning among IoD is required so that they can adaptively decide their path for data dissemination. Most of the existing solutions for this problem have made unreasonable assumptions and do not offer scalability. The scheme proposed in the paper provides a network architecture for the scalable solution of UAVs in an urban environment addressing issues of path planning, safety, privacy, and network connectivity.

The UAV-MTT system has great potentials to execute dull, dangerous, and critical missions for frontier defense and security. A key challenge in UAV-MTT is how to coordinate multiple UAVs to track diverse invading targets accurately and consecutively. In this article, we propose a UAV swarm-based cooperative tracking architecture to systematically improve the UAV tracking performance. We design an intelligent UAV swarm-based cooperative algorithm for consecutive target tracking and physical collision avoidance. Moreover, we design an efficient cooperative algorithm to predict the trajectory of invading targets accurately. Our simulation results demonstrate that the swarm behaviors stay stable in realistic scenarios with perturbing obstacles. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, such as the matched deep $Q$ -network, our algorithms can increase tracking accuracy by 60%, reduce tracking delay by 23%, and achieve physical collision-avoidance during the tracking process.  2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3085673</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

However, chasing both low-latency and reliability of consensus protocols is a challenging task. The problem is aggravated under wireless connectivity that may be slower and less reliable, compared to wired connections. To tackle this issue, we investigate fundamental relationships between consensus latency and reliability through the lens of wireless connectivity, and co-design communication and consensus protocols for low-latency and reliable decentralized systems. Specifically, we propose a novel communication-efficient distributed consensus protocol, termed random representative consensus (R2C), and show its effectiveness under gossip and broadcast communication protocols. To this end, we derive a closed-form end-To-end (E2E) latency expression of the R2C that guarantees target reliability, and compare it with a baseline consensus protocol, referred to as referendum consensus (RC). The result shows that the R2C is faster compared to the RC and more reliable compared when co-designed with the broadcast protocol compared to that with the gossip protocol. © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: W.

For better swarm coordination, a robust inter-UAV network, especially in ad hoc mode, is needed. Due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks owing to mobility and topology change, adapting routing quickly to topology changes is one of the key components of UAV networks. Based on investigating the relationship between the swarm formation control and the network topology, we propose a proactive topology-aware scheme to track the network topology change.

To this end, one of the important problems to address is how to support energy-efficient UAV operation while maintaining reliable connectivity between those aerial users and cellular networks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of cellular-connected UAV via jointly designing the mission completion time and UAV trajectory, as well as communication base station (BS) associations, while ensuring a satisfactory communication connectivity with the ground cellular network during the UAV flight. An optimization problem is formulated by taking into account the UAV’s flight energy consumption and various practical aspects of the air-ground communication models, including BS antenna pattern, interference from non-associated BSs and local environment. The formulated problem is difficult to tackle due to the lack of closed-form expressions and non-convexity nature. To this end, we first assume that the channel knowledge map (CKM) or radio map for the considered area is available, which contains rich information about the relatively stable (large-scale) channel parameters. By utilizing path discretization technique, we obtain a discretized equivalent problem and develop an efficient solution based on graph theory by employing convex optimization technique and a dynamic-weight shortest path algorithm over graph. Next, we study the more practical case that the CKM is unavailable initially. By transforming the optimization problem to a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on multi-step learning and double Q-learning over a dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, where the UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its moving policy according to its local observations of the measured signal samples. Extensive simulations are carried out and the results show that our proposed designs significantly outperform baseline schemes. Furthermore, our results reveal new insights of energy-efficient UAV flight with connectivity requirements and unveil the tradeoff between UAV energy consumption and time duration along line segments.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng Si-wei</author><author>Chen Jing</author><author>Shen Lin-Cheng</author><author>Tao Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECNP-based method of distributed dynamic task allocation for multiple observation satellite planning</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 2nd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computer Control, ICACC 2010</secondary-title><tertiary-title>Proceedings - 2nd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computer Control, ICACC 2010</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - 2nd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computer Control, ICACC 2010</full-title></periodical><pages>325-328</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>Artificial intelligence</keyword><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Swarm Intelligence</keyword><keyword>AGENTS</keyword><keyword>Cellular automata</keyword><keyword>Acquaintance's trusts</keyword><keyword>Extended contract net protocol</keyword><keyword>Mixed multi-attribute decision</keyword><keyword>Multi-attribute decisions</keyword><keyword>Multi-satellite planning</keyword><keyword>acquaintance's trusts</keyword><keyword>extended contract net protocol</keyword><keyword>mixed Multi-Attribute decision</keyword><keyword>multi-satellite planning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>27-29 March 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><isbn>978-142445846-2 (ISBN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICACC.2010.5486945</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A extended contract net protocol(ECNP) is introduced to solve the dynamic task allocation for multiple satellites collaborative planning system(MSCPS) in which the environment and capabilities of each Agent can dynamically change with time.

CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, mission-centric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. “Autonomy” is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Global Oceans 2020: Singapore – U.S. Gulf Coast&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Global Oceans 2020: Singapore – U.S. Gulf Coast</research-notes><custom3>Global Oceans 2020: Singapore – U.S. Gulf Coast</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

To achieve this reduced development time, the AMDF will use a new catalog-based and platform-based approach to mission design that emphasizes commonality at the subsystem or assembly level and the use of COTS components when possible. This will necessarily constrain the range of performance achievable by these missions, since only a few alternatives will be available for each subsystem. Only missions whose objectives can be achieved through a combination of the available modules will be considered. In addition to providing a high-level description of the AMDF architecture, this paper describes the process by which this platform consisting of a few standard modules will be optimally designed to maximize the range of attainable performance while keeping short development times. Particular emphasis is put on the communications module that will enable cross-links between nanosatellites, UAVs, balloons, and ground assets. Importantly, the AMDF focuses on a different customer segment than other similar NASA facilities such as the IDC at GSFC or Team X at JPL. AMDF Missions are not meant to compete with larger NASA missions in terms of performance, operational risk or mission assurance, but rather they intend to be complementary. In particular, the very short development time and multi-asset character of these systems will enable a completely new class of missions that can effectively respond to a rapidly changing phenomenon of opportunity, such as a hurricane, a volcano or a geopolitical event of interest for which a larger mission would be inappropriate. Additionally, they can be used to accelerate technology infusion for future larger missions, as long as the new technology satisfies a certain set of interface requirements. The AMDF will maximize reuse of existing design, integration and testing software and hardware infrastructure at NASA Wallops as well as other NASA centers. All potentially relevant stakeholders, such as NASA Goddard, Headquarters, JPL, Ames, the Aerospace Corp., Applied Physics Lab, and universities with nanosatellite programs will be involved and considered in the AMDF development process. This paper focuses on the description of the design aspects of the AMDF, as this is where most of the novelty lies. Integration, testing, launching and operations are only briefly discussed. A description of the system architecture of the AMDF is given using model-based systems engineering tools (SysML). An example application mission to measure ecological changes in the Jefferson and Washington National Forests is also discussed to illustrate the new kinds of missions that this facility could enable.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference</research-notes><custom3>2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

UAVs are being widely deployed in different verticals including surveillance, search and rescue missions, delivery of items, and as an infrastructure for aerial communications in future wireless networks. UAVs can be used to survey target locations, collect raw data from the ground (i.e., video streams), generate computing task(s) and offload it to the available servers for processing. In this work, we formulate a multi-objective optimization framework for both the network resource allocation and the UAV trajectory planning problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model. In consideration of the different stake holders that may exist in a Cloud-Fog environment, we minimize the sum of a weighted objective function, which allows network operators to tune the weights to emphasize/de-emphasize different cost functions such as the end-to-end network power consumption (EENPC), processing power consumption (PPC), UAV’s total flight distance (UAVTFD), and UAV’s total power consumption (UAVTPC). Our optimization models and results enable the optimum offloading decisions to be made under different constraints relating to EENPC, PPC, UAVTFD and UAVTPC which we explore in detail. For example, when the UAV’s propulsion efficiency (UPE) is at its worst (10% considered), offloading via the macro base station is the best choice and a maximum power saving of 34% can be achieved. Extensive studies on the UAV’s coverage path planning (CPP) and computation offloading have been conducted, but none has tackled the issue in a practical Cloud-Fog architecture in which all the elements of the access, metro and core layers are considered when evaluating the service offloading in a distributed architecture like the Cloud-Fog.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J. -J.

The cellular-connected UAV has a mission to travel from an initial location to a destination. In this process, there is a trade-off between the flight time and the expected communication outages duration, which requires planning a suitable route to avoid the weak coverage region. However, as the existing cellular networks are primarily designed for ground coverage, the communication coverage in the sky tends to be intermittent and irregular due to the potential for severe interference and obstructions (such by buildings), which brings great challenges to 3D path planning. To address this challenge, we first construct a 3D coverage map that stores the expected outage probability over each locations. We then propose a multi-step dueling DDQN (multi-step D3QN) based algorithm to design the local optimal UAV path by leveraging the constructed coverage map. In this algorithm, the UAV acts as the agent to learn the appropriate action to complete the flight mission. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for connectivity-aware UAV path planning and the superiority of 3D path design over its 2D counterparts.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

In mobile cloud computing (MCC) and mobile edge computing (MEC), UAVs assist ground user equipments (UEs) to offload traffic to cloudlet or cloud. In this scenario, different UEs may have different quality of experience (QoE) requirement. Moreover, the endurance flying as well as battery limitation of UAVs and UEs make this offloading architecture power sensitive. Thus, UEs' QoE, as well as overall system power consumption should be well-balanced by the MIMO channel assignment and UAVs' trajectory plan. This paper formulates such issue as a non-convex and mixed-integer optimization problem, and further proposes a heuristic joint power and QoE (HJPQ) algorithm to solve it. The numeral simulations reveal the algorithm has great QoE performance with high energy efficiency in different conditions.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)</research-notes><custom3>2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F. -q.

In this paper, an integrated process planning and scheduling system, which is applicable to the holonic manufacturing system is presented. Basic architecture of the target holonic manufacturing system is discussed from the viewpoint of the process planning and the scheduling systems. Process planning are proposed to select suitable machining sequences of machining features and suitable sequences of machining equipment, taking into consideration of future schedules of machining equipment. A fuzzy inference system(FIS) in choosing alternative machines for integrated process planning and scheduling of a job shop in HMS is presented. In order to overcome the problem of un-utilization machines, sometimes faced by unreliable machine, an improved particle swarm optimization(PSO) have been used to balance the load for all the machines.

Performance metrics are provided to help researchers to validate the impact of communication delays on the performance of the algorithm.  © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2022 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2022; Conference date: 21 June 2022 through 24 June 2022; Conference code: 181377&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2022, June 21, 2022 - June 24, 2022&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (ICUAS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Int.

However, such systems using RTK-GPS do not provide the protection against network instability, failure of the components that make up the RTK-GPS service. In other words, availability is not provided to ensure the stability of the RTK-GPS. In this paper, we propose an architecture enabling redundancy to improve the availability of RTK-GPS system by switching or parallelizing the GPS correction data sources. We also introduce how to propagate the correction messages through the drone network. After evaluating the system on empirical testbed, we validated that the correction messages propagated without delay, the message source was switched or multiplexed among several message sources through the proposed system when the network was unstable, and the switching time was short enough not to affect our propagation system. Consequently, we have confirmed availability through the proposed architecture of RTK-GPS redundancy.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

By using the huge potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mm-Wave, we develop a novel and practical multi-UAV assisted multi-tier HetNet model which consists of clustered aerial UAV base stations (U-BSs) and Poisson point process (PPP) based ground BSs (G-BSs) for emergency and crowded hotspot area. In a typical cluster, both ground user equipments (GUEs) and UAVs are modeled as Poisson cluster process (PCP) and scattered around the common cluster center. Specially, the analysis is conducted by adding two additional tiers which consist of multiple intra-cluster U-BSs and single G-BS in representative cluster so that the point sets of U-BSs and G-BSs are partitioned into two sub-sets, respectively, and a 4-tier network model is formed. To find the contribution of the inter-cluster associations on the performance of networks, we construct 2-tier and 4-tier association schemes. The 2-tier association allows a GUE associated only with intra-cluster U-BSs and G-BS, while the 4-tier association allows all inter/intra-cluster U-BSs and G-BSs can be associated. Then, according to stochastic geometry methods, statistical description of the downlink interferences experienced at a typical GUE is derived. This derivation yields the downlink coverage probabilities and total network throughput are obtained. It is achieved that association probabilities greatly depend on the distribution of daughter point process. UAVs' height and the distributions of U-BSs and GUEs impose non-monotonous impact on coverage probabilities. Due to severe inter-cluster interference, the achievable average area throughput is not always increasing with SINR so that there is an optimal SINR threshold. In addition, our analysis finds the proposed 4-tier association scheme outperforms the simple 2-tier one in terms of the average area throughput.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

UAVs inherently support features like mobility, flexibility, adaptive altitude, which make them a preferable option for dynamic surveillance of remote locations. Multiple UAVs can cooperatively work to accomplish surveillance missions more efficiently. However, the intermittent network connectivity and the limited onboard energy storage impose a great challenge on UAV-assisted remote surveillance. This paper presents an Energy-efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance (ECMS) system for surveillance of inaccessible regions. The system employs an optimal Multi-UAV Collaborative Monocular Vision (MCMV) topology to facilitate the surveillance with zero blind spot using minimum number of drones. We also propose an application-aware Multi-Path Weighted Load-balancing (MWL) routing protocol for handling congestion by distributing traffic among all available resources in UAV network and adaptively selecting the of source datarate (i.e. switching video resolution). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed surveillance system achieves coverage with lesser number of UAVs compared to the existing systems. It also achieves higher throughput, higher packet-delivery ratio, higher residual energy of UAVs, and lower end-to-end delay.  © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: C.

Amazon has an issued patent that describes how drones scan and collect data on their fly-overs while dropping off packages. In this context, we propose a path optimization algorithm for a drone multi-hop communications network that can carry and forward data in addition to its primary function of parcel deliveries. We argue that traditional Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) based protocols may not be efficient for this purpose. Therefore, this paper proposes a new DTN-based algorithm that optimizes drone flight paths in conjunction with optimized routing to deliver both parcels and data in a power efficient way and within the shortest possible time. We propose a heuristic algorithm called Weighted Flight Path Planning (WFPP) that priorities the data packets in an exchange pool in order to create an optimized path for the drones. Our approach is to determine a weight for each packet based on the packet's remaining time to live, priority, size, and location of the packet's destination. When two drones meet each other, they exchange the high weighted packets. Simulation studies show that WFPP delivers up to 25% more packets compared with EBR, EPIDEMIC, and a similar path planning method. Also, WFPP reduces the data delivery delays by up to 66% while the overhead ratio is low.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

This paper addresses the networking aspect and in particular the routing in such an ad hoc network during surface exploration. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) developed a wireless communication, localization, and timing system including a PHY and MAC for decentralized swarm communication. A decentralized routing protocol is required to realize multi-hop communication. Thus, the natural choice is an ad hoc network routing protocol. We introduce a simulation environment to study ad hoc network routing protocols for this application field. The network simulation provides a TDMA based MAC resembling DLR's system, an IEEE 802.11g MAC, and incorporates elevation data of the Moon's surface for realistic radio propagation modeling.

Spatial reuse has been adopted to enable simultaneous data transmission among unmanned aerial vehicles in a context of spatial diversity. This work introduces two types of UAV: a single main actor UAV and multiple actor UAVs. Since these UAVs cooperatively perform a mission, packet collisions and signal interference can degrade a real time data transmission among them. In light of this, we propose a circularly multi-directional beam forming array antenna to be used on the main actor UAV and each UAV is equipped with a directional antenna. These two kinds of antenna are deployed so that packet collisions and signal interference can be alleviated. The main UAV is positioned in the center and surrounded by actor UAVs. By using different antennas on different types of UAV and based on the UAVs positioning, the paper proposes two MAC protocols. While both proposed MAC protocols adopt a conventional IEEE 802.11 MAC, the second one introduces a certain threshold value of angle between UAVs to enable a spatial reuse. Simulation results confirm that our proposed MAC protocols offer a huge gain in system throughput compared to an IEEE 802.11 protocol.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)</research-notes><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

This study evaluates the trade-offs from a System-of-Systems (SoS) perspective between various UAV communications architecture options for the purpose of tracking ballistic missiles. An agent-based discrete event simulation is used to model a sensor communication network consisting of UAVs, military communications satellites, ground relay stations, and a mission control center. Network susceptibility to cyber attack is modeled with probabilistic failures and induced data variability, with performance metrics focusing on information availability, latency, and trustworthiness. Results demonstrated that using UAVs as routers increased SoS availability and satellite-based networks were best for long distance operations. Redundancy in the number of links between nodes helped mitigate cyber-caused link failures and add robustness in cases of induced data variability. Sensitivity studies indicated that long cyber-caused downtimes resulted in build-ups of failures, causing significant degradations in SoS performance.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 6th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 6th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering</research-notes><custom3>2011 6th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

For passive tags the factors affecting the performance of the reader-tag communication depends on many physical and geometrical parameters. Line of sight is a constraint of the reader-tag link while scattering objects producing electromagnetic interferences affect the shape and the extension of the read-zone i.e. the region where a reader can activate a tag. This region depends not only on the emitted power and reader/tag antennas radiation patterns but also on the propagation environment. When a number of readers are planned in a network, mutual coverage of read-zones and mutual interference among readers are undesired while safety regulation constraints have to be fulfilled in the whole area. Simple and effective models of electromagnetic elements involved in the planning are developed and included in the frame of a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

Meanwhile, emerging B5G services demand for higher SE in the NOMA-based wireless communications. However, traditional ground-to-ground (G2G) communications are hard to satisfy these demands, especially for the cellular uplinks. To solve these challenges, this article proposes a multiple unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs)-aided uplink NOMA method. In detail, multiple hovering UAVs relay data for a half of ground users (GUs) and share the spectrums with the other GUs that communicate with the base station (BS) directly. Furthermore, this article proposes a K-means clustering-based UAV deployment scheme and location-based user pairing (UP) scheme to optimize the transceiver association for the multiple UAVs-aided NOMA uplinks. Finally, a sum power minimization-based resource allocation problem is formulated with the lowest Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints. We solve it with the message-passing algorithm and evaluate the superior performances of the proposed scheduling and paring schemes on SE and energy efficiency (EE). Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the performances of the proposed schemes with those of the single UAV-aided NOMA uplinks, G2G-based NOMA uplinks, and the proposed multiple UAVs-aided uplinks with a facility location framework-based UAV deployment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multiple UAVs deployment and UP-based NOMA scheme significantly improves the EE and the SE of the cellular uplinks at the cost of only a little relaying power consumption of UAVs.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

Then we develop a two-level hierarchical UAV swarm architecture, including the low-level follower UAVs (FUAVs) and the high-level leader UAVs (LUAVs). For FUAVs, we design a coverage trajectory algorithm to carry out specific coverage tasks within patches based on the star communication topology. For LUAVs, we propose a swarm deep Q-learning (SDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm to select patches. Moreover, an observation history model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mean embedding method is integrated into SDQN to address the communication limitation problems of LUAVs. The numerical results show that FUAVs can cover the entire area of each patch with little redundancies, and the total coverage time of the SDQN is less than that of existing methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) being deployed to facilitate data collection from MTCDs is considered. Taking into account the limited energy for both the UAV and MTCDs, a problem of minimizing the total energy consumption subject to completion of the data collection tasks by planning the UAV trajectory is formulated. A Global Optimum (GOP) trajectory can be obtained for a UAV serving all the MTCDs simultaneously if the UAV’s flying altitude is larger than  $\sqrt {3}$  times its maximum service radius. However, communication energy efficiency drops as the UAV’s altitude increases. Clustering-based service strategies and dynamic trajectory planning algorithms, namely clustered GOP (C-GOP) and clustered particle swarm optimization (C-PSO), are proposed to overcome the above issue. The data collection efficiency is maximized by locating the optimal UAV hovering point for each serving MTCD cluster, which is dynamically adjusted with the UAV hovering position until all MTCDs are served. It is shown that the GOP is the optimal strategy for a small number of MTCDs concentrated in a small area. While for large number of MTCDs or task area, the clustered algorithms are more favorable from energy efficiency, complexity and scalability perspectives.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

The UTM system is proposed for UAV performance below and above 400 feet based on CAA regulations. A general ADS-B Like communication infrastructure adopting multiple communication devices is designed and tested for wide coverage considering sub-urban and remote areas. Based on the UAV Specification Management System (SMS), the hierarchical UTM will accept UAV flight applications by qualification verification of pilot and UAV registrations, and proceed to check the flight plan. One of the ADS-B like communication choice shall be selected and equipped on airborne with pilot's mobile phone being pre-test before flight approval. A "UTM Cloud" is constructed for data exchange and accessing. Flight surveillance data are reported into the Cloud with limited authorization to access by simple encryption. The UTM Center establishes parallel computer system with multi-window to display all UAVs in flight operation. UTM-based Detect and avoid (DAA) is activated by calculating the time to conflict (TTC) when two UAVs are approaching into the same airspace. Traffic alerts to pilots via personal mobile phones will be sent by voice calls from UTM controller for avoidance. Since the proposed ADS-B Like communication can cover wider range, the Regional UTM and National UTM are integrated in one center during the initial operations while UAV traffic density is still low. The prototype UTM is tested and demonstrated under hierarchical architecture to assure UAV flight safety.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)</research-notes><custom3>2019 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

Multi-UAV System of Systems (SoS) have proliferated due to their abilities to work autonomously, to decentralize mission workload and to exhibit resiliency in the ability to retain mission functionality even if a UAV node or network connectivity is lost. This resiliency is not inherent, and must be architected into both the SoS and UAV node/payload, especially in the areas of communications, control, ad-hoc networking, and path planning. As an exemplar, the Resilient System Engineering (RSE) process will be used to derive and identify resilience attributes for a Multi-UAV SoS architecture. For this paper, the Multi-UAV SoS will be tasked for Search and Rescue (SAR) and use a Time/Frequency Difference of Arrival (T/FDOA) based location algorithm to locate agents in distress. A simulation of the SAR SoS, using Contract-Based Design (CBD) invariant contracts are used to quantify the intended resilience/emergence attributes of the Multi-UAV SAR SoS and the T/FDOA location approach. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: E.B.

UAVs have been deployed for many applications and missions like data transmission, cellular service provisioning, and computational offloading tasks etc. Yet, UAV deployment is still limited, partially owing to the security challenges it poses. UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: G.

Vehicular Ad-hoc network (VANET) is an emerging technology where vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-toinfrastructure (V2I) communicate wirelessly using dedicated short-range communication band. In sensor based VANET (S-VANET) issues like response time, data aging, bandwidth, packet delivery, message prioritization and communication cost is a major concern. In this paper, we apply cognitive security protocol that disseminates information using distributed sensor technology while prioritizing prevention of data aging, efficient quality-of-service (QoS) and robustness against denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

Each UAV can first cache the sensing data and then report the cached data to the BS. We consider a time-slotted protocol to coordinate the UAVs' data collection and reporting. Only one UAV is allowed to forward its data to the BS in each time slot. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the longterm age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the UAVs' trajectories and scheduling strategies. To simplify this problem, we model the dynamics of the UAVs' data buffer and AoI statuses by queueing systems, and propose a novel AoI-aware Adaptation scheme. This scheme allows us to transform the multistage dynamic programming problem into per-slot scheduling and trajectory planning sub-problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, in each time slot, we can update the UAVs' scheduling and flying strategies in an iterative manner according to the instant buffer and AoI statuses. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline schemes in terms of reducing AoI while stabilizing and balancing the UAVs' data queues.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference</research-notes><custom3>GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

Focusing on this topic, the mechanisms for modeling and coordinating tasks are deeply studied in this article. After analyzing typical features of task cooperation, a hierarchical architecture of task models is firstly proposed and established, where mission, sub-mission and atom task models are designed, from the top-level to the bottom. Meanwhile, a policy-based parsing mechanism is proposed to autonomously decompose a mission into a set of atom tasks with special constraints. On this basis, resource related entities for various atom tasks are designed uniformly, and for the purpose of behavior synchronization, the concept of virtual logic task is further introduced and Topic-based communication channel is adopted over DDS middleware. Finally, a typical example is given and analyzed. In general, this work provides a feasible idea and method for constructing cooperative swarm intelligent systems.  © 2021 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.

This paper presents and evaluates a command architecture for a multi-spacecraft mission. It combines swarm techniques with a decentralized / local decision making architecture (which uses a set of shared blackboards for coordination) and demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. Under this approach, the Blackboard software architecture is used to facilitate data sharing between craft as part of a resilient hierarchy and the swarm techniques are used to coordinate activity. The paper begins with an overview of prior work on the precursor command technologies and then presents five command architectures for comparison purposes. Then, it presents a qualitative analysis of these techniques, followed by a quantitative analysis which characterizes the constellation's performance across a variety of prospective scenarios including normal operations, several mission scenarios which limit communications, operations in an intentionally communications-denied environment and operations across a variety of craft failure scenarios. From performance analysis, the utility of the techniques is analyzed. © 2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: J.

Multi-UAV systems organized in an ad hoc fashion called a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can cooperatively and collaboratively accomplish complex missions more efficiently compared to single large UAV systems. However, the unique features of FANETs such as high mobility, low node density, and high frequency of topology changes introduce challenges to the communication design, especially routing. Thus, the routing requirements of FANETs surpass those of MANETs or VANETs. In this paper, we present UAV classification, communication and application architectures, and an exhaustive survey of the existing routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks. Furthermore, we highlight the key features, strengths and weaknesses, and different mobility models used for the performance evaluation of the existing FANET routing protocols. More importantly, a proposed taxonomy and a review on the existing FANET routing protocols are presented. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges and open research issues.  1998-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2020.2982452</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Q.

However, current researches aimed to target tracking in mobile MC-SSN are very limited. This paper first proposes an adaptive fuzzy tree system (AFS) for target tracking in MC-SSN. To avoid oversimplifying the target mobile pattern, which is unrealistic in real tracking tasks, we introduce the target circle into the model considerations to add a bit of uncertainty about the target position. At each time step of the tracking process, strategy-selection layer will activate the pursuit strategy or the diffusion strategy for the specific situation, which makes the system more intelligent and can be applicable to various scenarios. The pursuit strategy is built by a two-layer fuzzy tree to select and mobilize sensors that have not detected target, while the diffusion strategy uses a fuzzy inference system to balance the density of detected sensors. And all the hyper-parameters are tuned by particle swarm optimization (PSO). We performed a large number of simulations with two target trajectories: line and irregular. The simulation results show that the AFS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm. Moreover, it is highly robust to various target motion patterns, making it competent for a variety of real target tracking scenarios.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

It is now possible to utilize tens and thousands of them to form a swarm to complete complicated cooperative tasks, such as searching, rescuing, mapping, and battling. A swarm usually contains a large number of robots or devices, which are in short distance to each other and may move dynamically. So this paper studies the dynamic and dense swarms. The ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is proposed to serve as the fundamental technique for both networking and localization, because UWB is so time sensitive that an accurate distance can be calculated using timestamps of the transmit and receive data packets. A UWB swarm ranging protocol is designed in this paper, with key features: simple yet efficient, adaptive and robust, scalable and supportive. This swarm ranging protocol is introduced part by part to uncover its support for each of these features. It is implemented on Crazyflie 2.1 drones, STM32 microcontrollers powered aerial robots, with onboard UWB wireless transceiver chips DW1000. Extensive real world experiments are conducted to verify the proposed protocol with a total of 9 Crazyflie drones in a compact area.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications</research-notes><custom3>IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The UGVs are used as mobile actuators and scattered in a large area. To achieve multi-UGV communication and collaboration, the UAV, modeled as a Dubins vehicle, serves as a messenger to fly over the effective communication range of all UGVs to relay information. The curvature-constrained path planning of the messenger UAV is formulated as a Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Dynamic Neighborhood (DTSPDN) which is a complex optimization problem involving coupled variables and contains dynamic constraints. We design an effective memetic algorithm to find the shortest route that enables the messenger UAV to visit all moving UGVs. This algorithm combines the genetic algorithm procedure, two kinds of local search operators based on gradient search and uniform sampling respectively, and a gradient-based repair operator to repair the solutions violating dynamic constraints. During the evolutionary process, a special phenomenon may occur that changing some decision variables (i.e., visiting sequence and location) may not affect the evaluation function value, but may alter the feasible region of another decision variable (i.e., visiting time) due to the encounter constraint between the UAV and UGV. To track and utilize the change of the feasible region, a transformation procedure is proposed to change one solution to another with less visiting time by analyzing the encounter pattern between UAV and UGV. The computational results on random instances with different scales demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively generate better curvature-constrained tours to encounter all moving UGVs when compared to other four competitive algorithms in the literature. Note to Practitioners—This paper studies an emerging path planning problem for a UAV which is used to provide communication service for multiple moving UGVs. These UGVs are required to execute tasks (e.g., firefighting, search and rescue) within a large area. Due to their limited communication capabilities, they may be unable to obtain necessary information from other UGVs. The UAV serves as a messenger to fly over the effective communication range of all moving UGVs to relay information. We propose a novel memetic algorithm to efficiently search for the shortest tour that enables the messenger UAV to visit all moving UGVs. The memetic algorithm combines the parallel global search virtue of genetic algorithm with efficient local search procedure to improve the generated tour. A gradient-based repair procedure is also employed to make sure that the planned tour can guide the UAV to sequentially encounter each moving UGV. Simulations exhibit that the proposed approach can effectively generate high-quality tours for messenger UAV to rapidly visit all UGVs, which assists UGVs to achieve collaboration in large area. In future work, the proposed memetic algorithm will be extended to plan tours for multiple messenger UAVs.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Dynamic, delay and disruption tolerant communications and networking topologies at various Quality of Service levels are needed to meet future mission requirements, which may include multiple spacecraft flying in formation and coordinating among themselves. Additionally, secure proximity-and autonomous-communication among various types of space vehicles are needed to share rich, near real-Time streams of information. Along with scalability and extensibility, cybersecurity is a crucial requirement for autonomous communications in space.TaraCoAP is based on the terrestrial standard Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and along with its Cyber-Physical Autonomous Asset Observation and Management extension provides delay and disruption tolerant, autonomous communication among swarms or clusters of spacecraft to implement complex and time-varying networks to coordinate, collaborate and share rich streams of information.

Specifically, they are made from commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronic circuit chips, and are thus seen as a cost effective replacement for traditional, expensive satellites. Moreover, they are expected to have higher capabilities to better support demanding missions. To date, most CubeSats rely on a single element antenna that usually has a relatively low gain and are not steerable. Thus, they are not suitable for long-distance communications and for use by missions requiring high-speed links and adjustable radiation patterns. Existing single element antennas also increase the probability of failure when establishing communication links, as the failure of the single element would lead to a disconnection. In this paper, we propose a 3×1 dipole antenna array and a cluster of three 3×1 dipole antenna arrays for CubeSats. Each array can theoretically be used on a separate frequency. Advantageously, all three arrays can be combined to enhance directivity. Our simulation results show that the proposed antenna cluster has a high gain of 5.03dB and wide directivity.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2016 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)</research-notes><custom3>2016 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

A unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) user and ground users (GUEs) are served by ground base stations (GBSs) by utilizing uplink NOMA protocol. The goal is to minimize the UAV mission completion time by jointly designing the UAV trajectory and UAV-GBS association vectors while considering the interference of UAV to other non-associated GBSs. The formulated problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem and involves infinite number of variables, which is difficult to be directly solved. To tackle this challenge, we first prove the optimal UAV trajectory satisfies \emph{fly-hover-fly} communication policy. With this insight, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the original problem based on a properly constructed graph by invoking graph theory and convex optimization techniques. Numerical results show that the UAV mission completion time is significantly minimized with proposed NOMA scheme compared with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) communication and reveal a tradeoff between the UAV mission completion time and GUEs' quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</research-notes><custom3>2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

We propose a new end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach to UAV-enabled data collection from Internet of Things (IoT) devices in an urban environment. An autonomous drone is tasked with gathering data from distributed sensor nodes subject to limited flying time and obstacle avoidance. While previous approaches, learning and non-learning based, must perform expensive recomputations or relearn a behavior when important scenario parameters such as the number of sensors, sensor positions, or maximum flying time, change, we train a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with combined experience replay to learn a UAV control policy that generalizes over changing scenario parameters. By exploiting a multi-layer map of the environment fed through convolutional network layers to the agent, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agent to make movement decisions for a variety of scenario parameters that balance the data collection goal with flight time efficiency and safety constraints. Considerable advantages in learning efficiency from using a map centered on the UAV's position over a non-centered map are also illustrated.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference</research-notes><custom3>GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9; Conference name: 2019 Winter Simulation Conference, WSC 2019; Conference date: 8 December 2019 through 11 December 2019; Conference code: 157944; CODEN: WSCPD&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 Winter Simulation Conference, WSC 2019, December 8, 2019 - December 11, 2019&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc.

Initial incorrect partitioning may influence the overall quality of the final architecture. In this paper Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based meta-heuristic methodologies has been tried for solving 3D IC partitioning problems. The proposed methodology minimizes number of Through Silicon Vias (TSV) and reduces heat dissipation in 3D IC partitioning. Large number of TSVs increases the chip area. Thus TSV minimization has an important role in 3D IC partitioning. Due to enhanced technology scaling and an increasing number of components with higher frequency, 3D chips have substantially higher power densities. The chip's performance and dependability are influenced by the heat dissipated by the employed power. The proposed method is also capable for reducing the heat dissipation of the entire chip. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using 3D-IC benchmark and the performance is compared with existing method. The experimental result shows that the proposed technique improves number of TSVs and required implementation area by up to 14.45% and 10.69% respectively with respect to existing method.  2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 1st International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies, ICEEICT 2022, February 16, 2022 - February 18, 2022&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 First International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies (ICEEICT)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 1st International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies, ICEEICT 2022, February 16, 2022 - February 18, 2022</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT53079.2022.9768552</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Trichy, India</custom1><custom3>1st International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Information and Communication Technologies, ICEEICT 2022, February 16, 2022 - February 18, 2022</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

Given their ability to explore difficult terrain in short spans of time, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become an increasingly valuable aid to search and rescue operations. Traditionally, UAVs utilize exhaustive lawnmower exploration patterns to locate stranded survivors, without any information regarding the survivor's whereabouts. In real life disaster scenarios however, on-ground observers provide valuable information to the rescue effort, such as the survivor's last known location and heading. In earlier work, a Weight Based Exploration (WBE) model, which utilizes this information to generate a prioritized list of waypoints to aid the UAV in its search mission, was proposed. This approach was shown to be effective for a single UAV locating a single survivor. In this paper, we extend the WBE model to a team of UAVs locating multiple survivors. The model initially partitions the search environment amongst the UAVs using Voronoi cells. The UAVs then utilize the WBE model to locate survivors in their partitions. We test this model with varying survivor locations and headings. We demonstrate the scalability of the model developed by testing the model with aerial teams comprising several UAVs.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)</research-notes><custom3>2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

In particular, we propose to deploy the UAVs as flying remote radio heads (RRHs) to serve ground user equipments (UEs). The baseband unit (BBU) is equipped with a large-scale antenna array to serve the flying RRHs and affords all the baseband signal processing. To optimize the proposed architecture, we consider the maximization of the minimum rate of UEs by jointly optimizing UAVs placement, quantization noise variance, and power control. The corresponding optimization problem is not convex and to solve it we devise an efficient iterative algorithm combining the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to two benchmark schemes.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.

The research is principally motivated by the need for offline and online motion planning for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For UAVs operating in large dynamic uncertain 4-D environments, the motion plan consists of a sequence of connected linear tracks (or trajectory segments). The track angle and velocity are important parameters that are often restricted by assumptions and a grid geometry in conventional motion planners. Many existing planners also fail to incorporate multiple decision criteria and constraints such as wind, fuel, dynamic obstacles, and the rules of the air. It is shown that MSA* finds a cost optimal solution using variable length, angle, and velocity trajectory segments. These segments are approximated with a grid-based cell sequence that provides an inherent tolerance to uncertainty. The computational efficiency is achieved by using variable successor operators to create a multiresolution memory-efficient lattice sampling structure. The simulation studies on the UAV flight planning problem show that MSA* meets the time constraints of online replanning and finds paths of equivalent cost but in a quarter of the time (on average) of a vector neighborhood-based A*.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

With the great capability of friendly uses and wide applications for multiple purposes, amateur drones can be piloted to effortlessly access any geographical area. This poses some difficulties in monitoring and managing drones that may invade private or limited-access areas. In this paper, we propose a radio-frequency (RF)-based surveillance solution to effectively detect and classify drones, and recognize operations by leveraging a high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed network, namely RF-UAVNet, is specified with grouped one-dimensional convolution to significantly reduce the network size and computational cost. Besides, a novel structure of multi-level skip-connection, for the preservation of gradient flow, incorporating multi-level pooling, for the collection of informative deep features, is proposed to achieve high accuracy via learning efficiency improvement. In the experiments, RF-UAVNet yields the accuracy of 99.85% for drone detection, 98.53% for drone classification, and 95.33% for operation mode recognition, numbers which outperform the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods on DroneRF, a publicly available dataset for RF-based drone surveillance systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

At the first level of hierarchy, we aggregate the high-dimensional control system of the swarm into a small-dimensional control system capturing its essential features. These features describe the position of the swarm in the world and its size. At the second level, we reduce the problem of controlling the essential features of the swarm to a model-checking problem. In the obtained hierarchical framework, high-level specifications given in natural language, such as linear temporal logic formulas over linear predicates in the essential features, are automatically mapped to provably correct robot control laws.

It can be classified for the purpose of its deployment, either in the civilian or military domain. The earliest usage of drones was totally for military purposes, but manufacturers promptly tested it for civilian fields like border surveillance, disaster relief, pipeline inspection, and rescue. Drone manufacturing, equipment installation, power supply, multi-rotor system, and embedded sensors are not the pressing issues for researchers of drone technologies. What is required is to utilize a drone for a complex operation and ensure secured data broadcasting among drones with the ground control station via a self-organized, resourceless, and infrastructureless network (Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs)). These operations are no less important in areas like an emergency, search and rescue operations, border surveillance, and physical phenomenon sensing for the end-user. However, it is not without some challenges for the researchers keeping in view the threats these operations are exposed to concerning security issues and challenges. To overcome these challenges, the researchers have to strive towards a secured drone operation by developing a robust and lightweight key agreement protocol for IoD deployment civilian drones. Consequently, the researchers in this study have attempted to design a key agreement scheme for the IoD deployment of civilian drones. The security of the proposed key agreement scheme has been verified by ProVerif2.02 and Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, while its performance scenario has been tackled by considering storage, computation, and communication overheads analysis. In comparing the proposed framework with prior protocols, it has been demonstrated that the scheme is quite efficient and may be recommended for operations in a given IoD environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

The results show that the model and method can comprehensively consider the actual operating characteristics of wind farm energy storage and effectively guide the energy storage configuration and construction planning of wind farms.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 4th Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 4th Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE)</research-notes><custom3>2022 IEEE 4th Eurasia Conference on IOT, Communication and Engineering (ECICE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W.

Existing detectors based on deep-learning methods usually apply the feature extraction networks with a large down-sampling factor to obtain higher-level features. However, such big stride tends to make the feature information of small objects become the little point or even vanish in the low-resolution feature maps due to the limitation of pixels. Therefore, a novel structure called Multi-branch Parallel Feature Pyramid Networks (MPFPN) is proposed in this article, which aims to extract more abundant feature information of the objects with a small size. Specifically, the parallel branch is designed to recover the features that missed in the deeper layers. Meanwhile, a supervised spatial attention module (SSAM) is applied to weaken the impact of background noise inference and focus object information. Furthermore, we adopt cascade architecture in the Fast R-CNN stage for a more powerful localization capability. Experiments on the public drone-based datasets named VisDrone-DET demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art detection algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and protocols provide a standard network layer among these varying scenarios and mitigate many challenges of the space environment, such as long delays, unplanned service interruptions, and asymmetric links. The Cognitive Space Gateway (CSG) is a routing method in a DTN architecture that uses spiking neural networks as the learning element to optimize routing decisions in a complex environment.This work aims to further develop cognitive networking technologies in several critical areas, including DTN, the CSG algorithm, SmallSat swarm topologies, and cloud services. The CSG algorithm is tested in a realistic scenario in which the emulated network topology is based on a SmallSat swarm. The emulation environment will be built upon a commercial cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud. This work investigates the ability of such a platform to enable a flexible, lower maintenance approach to creating a multi-hop network outside of a physical laboratory. The cloud platform will provide a secure environment allowing for collaboration among government and academic entities.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAAW)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAAW)</research-notes><custom3>2021 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAAW)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.

The steerable Yagi antenna consists of 3 elements lying on an FR4 substrate that form an angle with the CubeSat's surface. The key idea is to mechanically control the angle between the proposed antenna and the CubeSat's surface to achieve steerability and hence establish inter-satellite link. A scanning angle of 60 degrees can be achieved which could potentially support a variety of CubeSat missions. The proposed antenna was simulated using HFSS to show its steerability and S11 and radiation pattern measurements were carried out. The simulation results show that the antenna provides a maximum gain of 8.877dB and reflection coefficient of -16.73dB at 2.45GHz with a -10dB bandwidth of 250MHz. The measured reflection coefficient is -14.6dB with -10dB bandwidth of 200 MHz at a resonant frequency of 2.45GHz. The radiation pattern of the fabricated antenna was measured in the anechoic chamber located at the University of Wollongong and compared with the simulation results.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 13th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 13th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)</research-notes><custom3>2019 13th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The main contribution is to study a UAV cooperative formation control of tracking a moving target and analyze the flight stability of the designed controller when only knowing the UAV local information. The path planning of a single UAV and multiple UAV cooperative formation tracking of a moving target is studied. First, the feedback control is used to ensure heading convergence for the path planning of a single UAV. Furthermore, we use a variable airspeed controller to achieve the desired angular spacing and build the information architecture using graph theory for the UAV formation tracking of moving targets. The communication data management module at the cloud stores and transmits to UAV by the ground station. The ground command can maintain a UAV control center which gets access to the cloud for the UAV activity management. In addition, the design of a distributed control law is achieved based on the type of information construction between UAVs. The simulation results show that the designed controller is robust for tracking moving targets and achieves good flight-stability when tracking such targets.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition to interacting with the environment, can also communicate with each other over a noisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered explicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment, and the message each agent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the agents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate “effectively” over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the traditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message reliably over a noisy channel, and the “learning to communicate” framework that has received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying communication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that the joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where the communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP. This is a very powerful framework, which has many real world applications, from autonomous vehicle planning to drone swarm control, and opens up the rich toolbox of deep reinforcement learning for the design of multi-user communication systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

ANTS design principles draw on successes observed in the realm of social insect colonies, which include task specialization and sociality. ANTS spacecraft act as independent, autonomous agents for specific functions, while cooperating to achieve mission goals. For example, the Prospecting ANTS Mission (PAM) is a long-term mission concept for the 2020-2025 time frame involving individual spacecraft agents that are optimized for specific asteroid prospecting functions. The objective of PAM is to characterize at least one thousand asteroids during each year of operations in the main belt. To achieve this objective, PAM spacecraft, individually and as a group, must achieve a high level of autonomy. This high degree of autonomy opens the possibility of a new kind of interaction between humans and these spacecraft, where human explorers and developers could interact with ANTS enabled resources by communicating high-level goals and data products. Thus ANTS enables new kinds of missions in which human and robotic agents work together to achieve mission goals. In this paper we review and discuss the ANTS architecture in the context of the HEDS mission.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2003 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings (Cat.

The initial goal has been to create a simulation environment in which existing routing protocols from the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) areas can be evaluated in these types of networks. To show its capabilities, we performed simulations of the planned satellite constellations of Starlink and Telesat based on publicly available parameters. Through simulations of Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), we were able to gain valuable insights into the unique challenges presented to these protocols by satellite networks. It is unlikely that existing ad-hoc protocols using distance-vector routing or flooding can be used for broadband internet connectivity and alternative methods of handling large-scale mobility in these networks are needed. However, with ns-3-leo a much needed extension for supporting the development of protocols fulfilling the needs of satellite constellations is provided.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Specifically, we aim to minimize deployment and operational costs, with respect to budget and power constraints. To this end, we first optimize the number and locations of cluster heads (CHs) guaranteeing data collection from all sensors. Then, to minimize the data collection flight time, we optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. Accordingly, we distinguish two trajectory approaches: 1) where a UAV hovers exactly above the visited CH; and 2) where a UAV hovers within a range of the CH. The results of this include guidelines for data collection design. The characteristics of sensor nodes' K-means clustering are then discussed. Next, we illustrate the performance of optimal and heuristic solutions for trajectory planning. The genetic algorithm is shown to be near- optimal with only 3:5% degradation. The impacts of the trajectory approach, environment, and UAVs' altitude are investigated. Finally, fairness of UAVs trajectories is discussed.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</research-notes><custom3>2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

UAVs are also enabler in wireless communication that has potential features such as ubiquitous and reliable connectivity, fast and easy deployment, adaptive altitude, higher chance of line of sight (LOS) propagation path, higher mobility and flexibility. There are numerous surveys that summarized these advantages for different situations and scenarios. However, none of these surveys discussed the role of UAVs in public safety communications from the energy efficiency perspective. In this paper, we review the existing literature for UAV communication with taking into account the energy consumption criteria, and propose a multi-layered network architecture incorporating UAVs for public safety communication.

In this paper, we study UAV deployment problem in an integrated access and backhaul network, where a number of UAVs are deployed as aerial base stations (ABSs) or aerial relays (ARs) to forward GUs’ data packets to the remote gateway via multi-hop transmissions. Aiming at minimizing the system cost, which is defined as the weighted sum of UAV deployment cost and the energy consumption required for data transmission, a constrained system cost minimization problem is formulated, where UAV deployment, GU association and route selection problem are optimized. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we propose a two-stage heuristic algorithm. In the first stage, we focus on the optimal design of the access links and propose a joint ABS deployment and resource allocation algorithm. Specifically, a modified K-means based clustering scheme is proposed to determine ABS deployment and GU association strategy. Given the obtained ABS deployment strategy, in the second stage, we then design a joint AR deployment, route selection scheme for the backhaul links and propose a minimum circle algorithm-based AR deployment and route selection strategy. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 96th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2022-Fall)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 96th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2022-Fall)</research-notes><custom3>2022 IEEE 96th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2022-Fall)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R. t.

However, due to their low-gravity, variable sizes and shapes, dedicated orbiting spacecraft missions around these target bodies is difficult. Therefore, many planetary bodies are observed during flyby encounters, and consequently, the mapping coverage of the target body is limited. In this work, we propose the use of a spacecraft swarm to provide complete surface maps of a planetary body during a close encounter flyby. With the advancement of low-cost spacecraft technology, such a swarm can be realized by using multiple miniature spacecraft. The design of a swarm mission is a complex multi-disciplinary problem. To get started, we propose the Integrated Design Engineering &amp; Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software. In this work, we will introduce the development of the Automated Swarm Designer module of the software. The Automated Swarm Designer module will use evolutionary algorithms to optimize the design of swarms. The designed swarm will use 2 attitude control strategies to map the surface of a target body, namely: Nadir Pointing (NP), and Field of View Sweeping (FoV Sweeping). In the former strategy, the spacecraft are commanded to passively observe the sub-satellite point on the target body whenever the target is in the field of view of the individual spacecraft. This strategy is used when the observing instrument on board the spacecraft is large enough to capture the target from the desired encounter distance. In case the instrument is not large enough, then the spacecraft will have to maneuver their field of view to improve the coverage. The Field of View Sweeping strategy describes one such maneuver to improve coverage. In this strategy, the spacecraft in the swarm are commanded to sweep their fields of view about their principal axis normal to the swarm plane. The current work addresses different aspects of the swarm design problem. First, the coverage problem is addressed, and the parameters: instrument size, and target flyby distance are determined. Following this, the modeling of the swarm is described, where the individual spacecraft are arranged to define a circular plane around the target body during the encounter. Then the encounter trajectories of the spacecraft swarm are modeled. Here a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme using the state transition matrix of the dynamics is proposed for the entire swarm, which finds the trajectories between the desired starting points and destination points of the spacecraft within a specified flyby duration. Following this, the two proposed attitude control strategies are then described as they occur on these flyby trajectories. Then the design of these swarms is presented using as 2 optimization problems. The proposed strategies are used to develop a numerical simulator which will serve as the Automated Swarm Designer module of IDEAS for visual mapping missions. Finally, the simulator developed is demonstrated by designing a swarm using genetic algorithms for a visual mapping mission of asteroid 433 Eros.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference</research-notes><custom3>2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

However, the signals from multiple RF sources are aggregated at the airborne sensors, making it hard to achieve multi-emitter localization with a limited number of UAVs. In this paper, the Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) approach is applied to estimating ground targets’ locations exploiting the RSS data collected by the onboard sensors. Meanwhile, to support the BCS approach, which requires sufficient measurements to achieve multi-emitter localization, a sensing architecture comprising a limited number of UAVs is presented. Besides, to optimize the localization result, we put forward a trajectory planning-based Bayesian compressive sensing (TPBCS) algorithm. This algorithm dynamically plans UAVs’ trajectories based on the adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) algorithm, which can bring down the computational cost in UAV path planning compared to the traditional simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The effectiveness and robustness of the approach are validated by simulations in the end.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

However, how to reduce the maximum sidelobe level (SLL) of the beam pattern is a key problem in antenna arrays. In this paper, three kinds of antenna arrays that are linear antenna array (LAA), circular antenna array (CAA) and random antenna array (RAA) are investigated. First, we formulate the SLL suppression optimization problems of LAA, CAA and RAA, respectively. Then, we propose a novel method called improved chicken swarm optimization (ICSO) approach to solve the formulated optimization problems. ICSO introduces four enhanced strategies including the local search factor, weighting factor and global search factor into the update method of conventional chicken swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm, respectively, for achieving better beam pattern optimization results of antenna arrays. Moreover, a variation mechanism is proposed to enhance the population diversity so that further improving the performance of the algorithm. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed ICSO for the maximum SLL suppressions of LAAs, CAAs and RAAs, and the results show that ICSO obtains lower maximum SLLs for different antenna array cases with different numbers of antenna elements compared to several other algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

However, flying several UAVs at once poses many challenges to safely and efficiently localizing and monitoring them. Further, they need to maintain their formation distance to avoid collision between team members and any environmental obstacles. Besides, SUAVs are mainly equipped with an on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to obtain their positions, but they are not accurate enough and suffer from several vulnerabilities that restrict their applications. Thus, in GPS-denied situations, the acquisition of the positions of UAVs can be assisted by alternative technologies and solutions. This paper is one of the foremost in-depth works that present the topic of localization of SUAVs from various perspectives including current research challenges on positioning systems, telecommunication, and path planning, along with future opportunities on automated delivery services such as medicine, remote inspection of industrial sites, and precision agriculture.  © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: I.

In particular, we consider a swarm of hovering UAVs that relays information from a terrestrial base station to a distant mobile user and simultaneously generates friendly jamming signals to interfere/obfuscate an eavesdropper. Due to the limited energy of the UAVs, we develop a collaborative time-switching relaying protocol that allows the UAVs to collaborate in harvesting wireless energy, relay information, and jam the eavesdropper. To evaluate the performance, we derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for two popular detection techniques at the eavesdropper, i.e., selection combining and maximum-ratio combining. Monte Carlo simulations are then used to validate the theoretical SOP derivation. Using the derived SOP, one can obtain engineering insights to optimize the EH time and the number of UAVs in the swarm to achieve a given secrecy protection level. Furthermore, simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of SOP compared to the conventional AF relaying system. The analytical SOP derived in this work can also be helpful in future UAV secure-communication optimizations (e.g., trajectory and locations of UAVs). As an example, we present a case study to find the optimal corridor to locate the swarm so as to minimize the system SOP. Our proposed framework helps secure communications for various applications that require large coverage, e.g., industrial IoT, smart city, intelligent transportation systems, and critical IoT infrastructures, such as energy and water.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 27; Correspondence Address: Y.

For example, the wireless sensor network with backscatter communication technology can monitor the environment in remote areas without battery maintenance or replacement. Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter communication is limited. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-UAV-aided data collection scenario where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fly close to the backscatter sensor node (BSN) to activate it and then collects the data. We aim to minimize the total flight time of the rechargeable UAVs when the collection mission is finished. During the data collection process, the UAVs can return to the charging station to recharge itself when the energy of UAV is not sufficient to complete the mission. To reduce the complexity of the task, we first use the Gaussian mixture model clustering method to divide the BSNs into multiple clusters. Then we consider the deterministic boundary and ambiguous boundary for the UAV flying regions, respectively. For the deterministic boundary scenario, we propose a single-agent deep option learning (SADOL) algorithm, where each UAV cannot fly beyond the deterministic boundary. For the ambiguous boundary scenario, we propose a multiagent deep option learning (MADOL) algorithm to enable the UAVs to cooperatively learn the ambiguous BSNs assignment. In the simulation, we compare the proposed algorithms with multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and deep Q-network (DQN) algorithms, which proves the proposed algorithms can achieve better performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

During the hovering periods, the UAV works on full-duplex mode to simultaneously collect data from the target device and charge other devices within its coverage. Practical propulsion power consumption model and non-linear energy harvesting model are taken into account. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize three objectives: maximization of sum data rate, maximization of total harvested energy and minimization of UAV's energy consumption over a particular mission period. These three objectives are in conflict with each other partly and weight parameters are given to describe associated importance. Since IoT devices keep gathering information from the physical surrounding environment and their requirements to upload data change dynamically, online path planning of the UAV is required. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve online decision. An extended deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn control policies of UAV over multiple objectives. While training, the agent learns to produce optimal policies under given weights conditions on the basis of achieving timely data collection according to the requirement priority and avoiding devices' data overflow. The verification results show that the proposed MODDPG (multi-objective DDPG) algorithm achieves joint optimization of three objectives and optimal policies can be adjusted according to weight parameters among optimization objectives.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

In this scenario, Cooperative Multi-Robot / Multi-Sensor systems represent a new generation of ICT systems [1] [2], where mobile physical agents, equipped with sensors and/or actuators, may replace human operators in performing tasks in hazardous or risky environments. In this context the Center for TeleInFrastruktur (CTIF) Italy, with its headquarter at University of Rome "Tor Vergata", and the Italian company Space Software Italia (SSI), have realized a device that allows to mobile physical agents to perform operations within a spatial-temporal area defined by mission data. Such a device is enough small to be easily integrated within physical agents. Moreover, changing not so much software and no modifying hardware, we have implemented several functions. The system is geo-referenced since it foresees a GPS receiver assembled in the device that communicates with a microcontroller. A demo has been developed by us in order to simulate a geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system. The paper aims at showing the geo-referenced swarm agents enabling system architecture together with the development issues.

With the possibility of diminished UHF relay assets for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission, supporting such a technology requires a high performance antenna array system in order to enable substantial return of valuable scientific data. We propose a novel X-band single feed circularly polarized antenna subarray comprised of half E-shaped elements, optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization. The subarray architecture is modular, fed by a waveguide feed network, enabling high power handling capability.

In this paper, we investigate the planning process for a 5G radio access network having mmWave Micro Remote Radio Units (mRRUs) on top of sub-6 GHz Macro Remote Radio Units (MRRUs). We rely on proper channel models and link budgets as well as Urban Macro-cells (UMa) and Urban Micro-cells (UMi) characteristics to carefully formulate a 5G network planning optimization problem. We aim to jointly determine the minimum number of MRRUs and mRRUs to install and find their locations in a given geographical area while fulfilling coverage and user traffic demand constraints. In order to solve this planning process, we propose a two-step process where we first employ a low complexity meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the locations of RRUs followed by an iterative elimination method to remove redundant cells. To evaluate the performances of this proposed approach, we conduct a comparative study using Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing. Simulations results using sub-6 GHz UMa and 28 GHz UMi demonstrate the ability of the proposed planning approach to achieve more than 98% coverage with minimum cell capacity outage rate, not exceeding the 2%, for different scenarios and illustrate the efficiency of the evolutionary algorithms in solving this NP-hard problem in reasonable running time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Technological advances in this field have made it possible to coordinate the flight of these aircraft so as to conform a swarm. A UAV swarm is defined as a group of UAVs working collaboratively to carry out more complex missions or perform tasks more efficiently. Common applications of these swarms include rescue missions, precision agriculture, and border control, among others. However, there are still certain problems that prevent us from ensuring the success of their mission, especially as the number of drones in a swarm increases. In this paper, we specifically address the problem of a swarm take-off by optimizing the total time involved, while guaranteeing the safety of the UAVs during the take-off stage. To this end, we propose a new approach that combines a collision detection algorithm based on trajectory analysis with a batch generation mechanism that we use in order to determine the take-off sequence. Experiments show that our algorithm offers an efficient solution, managing to improve the performance of existing take-off techniques.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)</research-notes><custom3>2022 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

The application of ecodriving initiatives in lines equipped with automatic train operation (ATO) systems can provide important savings with low investments. Previous studies carried out under the ATO framework have not considered the main uncertainties in the traffic operation: the train load and delays in the line. This paper proposes a method to design robust and efficient speed profiles to be programmed in the ATO equipment of a metro line. First, an optimal Pareto front for ATO speed profiles that are robust to changes in train load is constructed. There are two objectives: running time and energy consumption. A robust optimization technique and an alternative method based on the conservation of the shape of the speed profiles (pattern robustness) are compared. Both procedures make use of a multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then, the set of speed profiles to be programmed in the ATO equipment is selected from the robust Pareto front by means of an optimization model. This model is a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to minimize the total energy consumption considering the statistical information about delays in the line. This procedure has been applied to a case study. The results showed that the pattern robustness is more restrictive and meaningful than the robust optimization technique as it provides information about shapes that are more comfortable for passengers. In addition, the use of statistical information about delays provides additional energy savings between 3% and 14%.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Here, the satellite delivers signal to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through a FSO link subject to Gamma-Gamma distributed turbulence, while the UAV forwards the decoded signal to multiple users through RF links characterzied by the correlated Rayleigh fading channel. By adopting that the selective decode-and-forward (DF) protocol at the UAV, we derive a closed-form expression for ergodic capacity (EC) of the considered system, where the RF link exploits transmit beamforming (BF) based on statistical channel state information (CSI) to obtain better performance than single antenna scenarios in existing works. Then, with the help of the derived EC and the available statistical CSI, a novel proportional fair scheduling (PFS) scheme is proposed. Finally, numerical results are conducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed scheduling scheme.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X. -c.

However, the problem of planning an energy-efficient path for the surveillance purpose while anticipating disturbances and predicting energy consumptions during the path tracking is still a challenging problem in recent years. The optimal path planning and the disturbance rejection control for a UAV surveillance system are investigated in this paper. A trained and tested energy consumption regression model is used to be the cost function of an optimal path planning scheme, which is designed from a clustered 3D real pilot flight pattern with the proposed K-agglomerative clustering method, and is processed via A-star and set-based particle-swarm-optimization (S-PSO) algorithm with adaptive weights. Moreover, an online adaptive neural network (ANN) controller with varied learning rates is designed to ensure the control stability while having a reliably fast disturbance rejection response. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified by numerical simulations and experimental results. By applying the proposed optimal path planning scheme, the energy consumption of the optimal path is only 72.3397 Wh while the average consumed energy of real pilot flight data is 96.593Wh. In addition, the proposed ANN control improves average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of horizontal and vertical tracking performance by 49.083% and 37.50% in comparison with a proportional-integral-differential (PID) control and a fuzzy control under the occurrence of external disturbances. According to all of the results, the combination of the proposed optimal path planning scheme and ANN controller can achieve an energy-efficient UAV surveillance systems with fast disturbance rejection response.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

We propose a completely distributed architecture, where robots dynamically allocate their tasks while they are building their plans. We first focus on the problem of simple "goto" tasks allocation: our approach involves an incremental task allocation algorithm based on the Contract-Net protocol. We introduce a parameter called equity coefficient in order to equilibrate the workload between the different robots and to control the triggering of the auction process. Then, we address the problem raised by temporal constraints between tasks by dynamically specifying temporary hierarchies among the tasks. Tests run in simulation quantify the benefits of our improvements.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004.

Clustering technique is one of the methods utilized to extend lifetime of the network by applying data aggregation and balancing energy consumption among sensor nodes of the network. In this paper, we propose the recently developed, Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for minimizing the intra-cluster distance and optimizing the energy consumption of the network. HSA is music based meta-heuristic optimization method which is analogous with the music improvisation process where musician continue to polish the pitches in order to obtain better harmony. A comparison is made with the well known cluster-based protocol approach developed for WSNs known as Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), heuristic optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm(GA) as well as the traditional K-means and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol using HSA can reduce energy consumption and improve the network lifetime.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops</research-notes><custom3>2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V.

The objective of this study is to assess the capabilities of UAV for slope mapping. This study only concentrates on multi-rotor UAV, which is known as Hexacopter. Several ground control points (GCP) and checked point (CP) were established using total station in the simulated model and slope area. GCPs were used in exterior orientation during image processing in sequence to transform image coordinates into the local coordinate system. Checkpoints were established in the simulated model and slope area for accuracy assessment. There are two types of surveys that have been applied in this study, namely, field survey, and UAV platform. Digital camera was mounted vertically at the bottom of UAV and it captured the images at low altitude. All acquired images went through all photogrammetric processing including interior orientation, exterior orientation and bundle adjustment using photogrammetric software. Two main photogrammetric results were produced, i.e digital orthophoto and digital elevation model of the simulated model and slope study area. Based on the results, it was found that the multi-rotor UAV is suited in mapping the simulated model and slope area with reliable accuracy.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)</research-notes><custom3>2015 International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dong-Uck Kong</author><author>T.

Acting as an energy source, the UAV operates at a fixed height and transfers energy to the multiple sensor nodes (SNs) via wireless signals. For more efficient energy harvesting (EH), an antenna array has been installed on UAV with a structure of three dimensional (3D) uniform linear array (ULA), which enables the UAV to perform analog beamforming for power concentration. Taking into account the UAV energy consumption and considering a practical nonlinear EH model, we characterize the UAV energy efficiency particularly for WPT task and subsequently formulate an efficiency maximization problem, in which the analog beamforming and UAV trajectory planning are jointly determined together with the transmit power control scheme. To deal with the nonconvex joint optimization problem, we first propose a cosine-based approximation for the complicated 3D ULA antenna pattern, in which a convex property is proved. Combining with the proved convexity in nonlinear EH model, through a series of mathematical analysis, we construct a convex subproblem based on any feasible point, solving which guarantees an improvement of the energy efficiency. Afterwards, an iterative algorithm is proposed for iteratively addressing the joint design until a convergence to a suboptimal solution. Via simulations, we verify the convergence and performance advantages of our proposed iterative solution. Among the solution, different beamforming preferences regarding the beam coverage enlargement and power concentration are also observed with respect to different antenna array scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed to search for novel architectures without human intervention that can achieve comparable performance to those of human-designed architectures. This work is inspired by current neural architecture search approaches based on reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm. However, not much attention is paid towards swarm intelligence metaheuristics-based neural architecture search. A framework is proposed for automatically designing neural architectures based on a swarm intelligence metaheuristic: Crow Search Algorithm. First, Crow Search Algorithm is integrated with binary network representation. To make it compatible for Neural Architecture Search, the original distance metric is replaced with hamming distance-based similarity measure. Second, the tuning parameters of Crow Search Algorithm are reduced by replacing the static flight length parameter with our dynamic flight length distribution algorithm. Third, the target selection method (random selection) is replaced by tournament select method. The proposed framework is used to search for architectures on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets and achieved 0.18%, 3.48%, and 15.64% test error, respectively. Furthermore, small-scale transfer experiments are conducted to search architectures for Tiny ImageNet and achieved 34.43% test error. Nonparametric statistical analysis is performed to validate the impact of each modification in improving the quality of search space exploration. The proposed framework has achieved comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approaches, with a comparatively simpler approach and minimum human intervention. The proposed framework can be used to develop completely automated systems for designing architectures for various data-based classification applications.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

This is a principle that takes inspiration from the nature, that maximizes the possibility of monitoring the environment and therefore of anticipating risks and finding targets. In robotics, alongside these reasons, the organization of a robot team in a formation allows a human operator to deal with a high number of agents in a simpler way, moving the swarm as a single entity. In this context, the typology of visual feedback is fundamental for a correct situational awareness, but in common practice having an optimal camera configuration is not always possible. Usually human operators use cameras on board the multirotors, with an egocentric point of view, while it is known that in mobile robotics overall awareness and pattern recognition are optimized by exocentric views. In this article we present an analysis of the performance achieved by human operators controlling a swarm of UAVs in formation, accomplishing different tasks and using different point of views. The control architecture is implemented in a ROS framework and interfaced with a 3D simulation environment. Experimental tests show a degradation of performance while using egocentric cameras with respect of an exocentric point of view, although cameras on board the robots allow to satisfactorily accomplish simple tasks.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 24th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 24th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)</research-notes><custom3>2015 24th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

However, it is challenging to achieve real time tracking while keeping the MCSN a long life time with limited energy provision in a complicated environment. In this paper, we develop a collaborative perception and intelligent scheduling scheme, which jointly optimizes the system responding latency and tracking accuracy with the constraint of the available energy. A new hierarchical architecture is proposed to realize the coupled function of perception and computation. In particular, the multi-node collaborative perception scheme is applied to obtain the excellent sensing capacity, and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play as the edge nodes to provide the computing service for those resource-constrained sensor nodes. To reach the sustained target tracking, we propose an intelligent tracking policy by exploiting the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent collaboration scheme can improve the tracking accuracy by 45.5% compared with the random selection scheme. The system cost is also reduced approximately by 17.3% while guaranteeing the tracking accuracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

By implementing these algorithms in Matlab, we will use worked examples to show how each algorithm works. Firefly algorithm is one of the evolutionary optimization algorithms, and is inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies in nature. There are many noisy non-linear mathematical optimization problems that can be effectively solved by Metaheuristic Algorithms. Mathematical optimization or programming is the study of such planning and design problems using mathematical tools. Nowadays, computer simulations become an indispensable tool for solving such optimization problems with various efficient search algorithms. Nature-inspired algorithms are among the most powerful algorithms for optimization. Firefly algorithm is one of the new metaheuristic algorithms for optimization problems. The algorithm is inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies. A Firefly Algorithm (FA) is a recent nature inspired optimization algorithm, which simulates the flash pattern and characteristics of fireflies. It is a powerful swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the flash phenomenon of the fireflies. In this context, three types of meta-heuristics called Artificial bee Colony algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Firefly algorithms were devised to find optimal solutions of noisy non-linear continuous mathematical models. A series of computational experiments using each algorithm were conducted. The stimulation result of this experiment were analyzed and compared to the best solutions found so The Firefly algorithm in each noisy non linear optimization function seems to perform better and efficient.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)</research-notes><custom3>2013 Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

In this article, we formulate the beam pattern optimization problems, and propose an improved invasive weed optimization with random mutation and Lévy flight (IWORMLF) algorithm to synthesize the beam patterns of linear antenna arrays (LAAs) and circular antenna arrays (CAAs). IWORMLF introduces the random mutation operator and the Lévy flight mechanism to enhance the efficiency and to balance the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm for optimization problems. Several simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. First, IWORMLF is tested by a variety of benchmark functions, and the results indicate that it achieves the best performance in most of the functions compared to some other algorithms. Second, IWORMLF is utilized for the maximum sidelobe level (SLL) reduction and the joint maximum SLL and mainlobe beamwidth reductions. The results show that it achieves better performances in terms of the convergence rate, stability, and accuracy compared to some evolutionary algorithms for these optimization cases. Third, the efficiencies of the improved factors are verified. Finally, electromagnetism simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of IWORMLF for the beam pattern optimizations with considering mutual coupling.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

The method adopts the distributed architecture to improve the effectiveness of system optimization and the stability of system operation, which is suitable for the high-density network where the distribution of intersections is dense and traffic flow varies frequently. The method takes travel time delay and average queue ratio as the optimal objectives to build the traffic signal optimal model based on cell transmission model, and employs the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm and goal programming principles to optimize the traffic control parameters of the intersections. This method can improve the reaction speed for each intersection, timely optimize and assign space-time resource for the traffic flow in the network, and eliminate the gridlock caused by the too long queue that spreads to the upstream intersection. 2010 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2010 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 2010 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication, ICFCC 2010&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 2010 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication, ICFCC 2010</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497360</url></text-urls></urls><custom3>Proceedings of the 2010 2nd International Conference on Future Computer and Communication, ICFCC 2010</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R. t.

The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) has identified at least twenty enabling and enhancing goals to fulfill the existing lunar exploration Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKG). Several of these goals will require multi-asset missions to the surface of the Moon involving human and machine interaction, as well as access to a ground station on Earth. Therefore, a communication enabling constellation deployed around the moon will serve as a crucial enabling technology for such missions. However, the limited orbital stability of lunar orbits constrains the use of traditional central body orbits for designing these constellations. The Earth-Moon Lagrange points, on the other hand, offer a viable location to deploy these constellations. The stationarity of the Lagrange points coupled with the fact that they have a large line of sight access area to the Moon's surface makes them a viable candidate for deploying constellations with a minimal number of spacecraft. However, the design of a Lagrange point constellation mission is not straight forward. This involves selecting the Lagrange points that offer the optimal coverage, optimal quasi-stationary trajectories around these Lagrange points, the optimal transfer to these trajectories, and the design of the constituent spacecraft. Clearly, this multi-disciplinary problem can benefit from a unifying mission design architecture that simultaneously handles the above-mentioned challenges. In our previous work, we developed the Integrated Design Engineering and Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software do design swarm missions to solar system small bodies. This work will focus on extending the capability of the IDEAS architecture to design optimal constellations deployed at the Earth-Moon Lagrange points. The constellation will be designed to act as a relay network to Earth with a minimum number of spacecraft. The performance of the constellation will be noted by studying the accessible regions on the surface of the moon. The approach taken by this work is as follows. We begin by modeling the coverage of spacecraft antenna by studying the accessible areas. The spacecraft will be assumed to be in halo orbits about the colinear Lagrange points. A selection scheme for the halo orbits is then discussed in order to coverage, synchronization, and stability requirements. Finally, the principles described are demonstrated by designing a Lagrange point constellation with three spacecraft that have access to at least 85 % of the Moon's surface and can communicate with at least 70 % of the surface at any given instant. The requirements and performance of this constellation are then evaluated assuming state-of-the-art hardware capabilities. The results indicate successful performance of the developed algorithms thus enabling the IDEAS architecture to generate holistic optimal designs which will greatly increase the returns of the future missions to the Moon. © 2020 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Conference name: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020; Conference date: 7 March 2020 through 14 March 2020; Conference code: 162583&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE (AEROCONF 2020)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020, March 7, 2020 - March 14, 2020&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Aerosp.

In order to shorten the length of the travel path and further reduce the energy consumption of the network transmission, the mobile sinks travel path was planned. Determining the visiting point of each overlapping area, and use the wolf pack algorithm (WPA) to plan a traveling path. Because the visiting point is a point within the overlapping area of communication ranges of sensors not one by one access to each node, it effectively reduces the length of the path. This method not only shortens the length of the traveling path for the mobile sink but reduces the computational effort required for traveling-path planning by the TSP algorithm as well.

The quick deployment of WSN, comprised of ground sensors and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) flying above building height, enables a new communication network to be formed instantly. However, due to the obstruction of buildings and movement of sensor nodes, communications among the sensor nodes is intermittent resulting in frequent partitioning of the network. The epidemic routing protocol, with its simple and robust flooding nature has made communication in a partitioned network possible, exploiting the mobility of the network nodes and based on pair-wise communication. However, due to the broadcast nature of this protocol, problems such as redundancy rebroadcast, contention and collisions, collectively known as the broadcast storm problem, have been observed. We first recommend a more detailed radio propagation modelling approach for the urban environment for more realistic simulation studies. Further, we propose an adaptive probabilistic epidemic protocol for WSN in the urban environment that adapts to the network topology over time. Through simulation studies, we show that this protocol improves the performance of the WSN in terms of data packet delivery probability compared to the case without probabilistic transmission in epidemic protocol.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks</research-notes><custom3>2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

When employing state-of-the-art deep learning-based traffic predictors in FL systems, the existing FL frameworks confront overlarge communication overhead when transmitting these models’ parameter updates since the modeling depth and breadth renders them incorporating an enormous number of parameters. In this article, we propose a practical FL scheme, namely, Clustering-based hierarchical and Two-step-optimized FL (CTFed), to tackle this issue. The proposed scheme follows a divide et impera strategy that clusters the clients into multiple groups based on the similarity between their local models’ parameters. We integrate the particle swarm optimization algorithm and devises a two-step approach for local model optimization. This scheme enables only one but representative local model update from each cluster to be uploaded to the central server, thus reduces the communication overhead of the model updates transmission in FL. CTFed is orthogonal to the gradient compression- or sparsification-based approaches so that they can orchestrate to optimize the communication overhead. Extensive case studies on three real-world data sets and three state-of-the-art models demonstrate the outstanding training efficiency, accurate prediction performance, and robustness to unstable network environments of the proposed scheme.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>T.

Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions are one of the core features of IoT. The M2M means the exchange of data among two or more entities, objects or machines, which do not require human interaction. To tackle the sustainability constraints of present IoT models, few developing models are thought to have been promised with new models. However, the fully usage of these models from communication, computing, and data processing for enhancing the energy efficiency of IoT still faces several basic defects.

To validate our approach, we compare the routing performance of our architecture with a classical solution based on the AODV routing protocol and the use of iptables rules.

Beyond the limits of single UAV system, multi-UAV systems which can perform complex missionoriented tasks better have been recently introduced. However, previous systems are less automated in the way that human intervention is still required to execute missions, and they were implemented for the only purpose of carrying out specific scenarios. In this paper, in order to automate the required procedures in the system and increase system flexibility, we propose a control integrated query processing system for coordination of multiple UAVs. We devise a high level query language to express a user command for a variety of UAVs' tasks by integrating the ways of controlling movements and actions of multiple UAVs and collecting data from them.

This could open the door to new exciting applications in earth observation, telecommunication or in-orbit servicing. Such missions are expected to have important benefits in terms of low system and deployment costs, distributed sensor capability or high reliability due to redundancy. In order to take advantage of a swarm configuration, a communication concept is required, which deals in a generic way with specific space environments and is able to cope with frequent topology changes. Up to now, space communication has only addressed static inter-satellite links (ISL), mainly based on proprietary protocols. In this paper, we propose to adopt well-known terrestrial communication standards. Such standards have been proven to be well conceived for a wide range of applications. WiFi is one prominent representative of such candidates which includes the ability of ad-hoc networking in order to provide decentralized and distributed wireless networks. Space specific requirements demand minor adaptions of the communication protocols. COTS components are also suitable for such protocols with minor changes. This paper studies these adaptions in depth, both in theory and by simulations and is therefore an important step towards its realization. To our knowledge, there is currently no suitable communication technology which has been adapted for swarm missions with small satellites. © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: 2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference; Conference date: 1 March 2014 through 8 March 2014; Conference code: 106118&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Aerosp.

This is especially necessary and important when carrying out tasks on distributed machines in a formation. Examples for application are parallel harvesting process in agricultural business or the cooperative search for survivors after a snow slide or e.g. an earthquake in urban scenarios. Moreover, it is very important to ensure relative position information in case of partial failure or a poor reception of the GNSS receiver, for example to avoid the collision between the machines. Options to handle this problem are the coupling of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements with measurements of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). A further improvement or stabilization can be done by vision based systems, like 2D- or 3D-camera system using methods of optical flow for motion estimation. Another possibility for improvement for determining the swarm geometry, which will be described in this paper, is the so called swarm positioning method. This method is based on the exchange of the measured GNSS raw data, i.e. range measurements, between each participant in the swarm using a mobile ad-hoc network. Additionally, GNSS raw measurements and inertial measurements are coupled using multiple filters in order to detect degraded GNSS measurements and exclude these from further data processing. The challenge of the mobile ad-hoc network is the time variant network structure and the small available transmission rate in combination with a high demand for quick data exchange. The requirement to respond very flexibly to changes in topology and to compensate the loss of individual network participants as well as to spontaneously integrate further participants forbids the use of a fixed coordinator. Therefore different routing algorithms have to be combined and developed to ensure an information exchange in various scenarios.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium</research-notes><custom3>Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

As a consequence of this Electric Vehicle (EV) has emerged as an environment friendly solution for the automobile industry. For large scale deployment of EVs development of proper charging infrastructure is indispensable. Charging stations (CS) must be placed in the transport network in such a way that the distribution network parameters are least affected. This work proposes a novel approach for co-ordinated planning of EV charging infrastructures considering superimposition of both transport and distribution network. This approach is validated on IEEE 33 bus distribution network superimposed with 25 node road network. The capability of a new hybrid algorithm which is an amalgamation of Chicken Swarm Algorithm (CSO) and Teaching Learning Based Optimization Algorithm (TLBO) is utilized in this work for attaining optimal solution.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 Third International Conference on Research in Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (ICRCICN)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2017 Third International Conference on Research in Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (ICRCICN)</research-notes><custom3>2017 Third International Conference on Research in Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (ICRCICN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Control the path of robot to reach at the exact target without effecting by environmental conditions is the most difficult task to obtain. Multi-Robotic path planning is a challenging computational problem seduce in robotics because of its complexity and high cost by the number of robots.

Motor imagery (MI), in which motor actions are mentally rehearsed without engaging in actual physical execution, has been widely used as a major BCI approach. One robust algorithm that can successfully cope with the individual differences in MI-related rhythmic patterns is to create diverse ensemble classifiers using the subband common spatial pattern (SBCSP) method. To aggregate outputs of ensemble members, this study uses fuzzy integral with particle swarm optimization (PSO), which can regulate subject-specific parameters for the assignment of optimal confidence levels for classifiers. The proposed system combining SBCSP, fuzzy integral, and PSO exhibits robust performance for offline single-trial classification of MI and real-time control of a robotic arm using MI. This paper represents the first attempt to utilize fuzzy fusion technique to attack the individual differences problem of MI applications in real-world noisy environments. The results of this study demonstrate the practical feasibility of implementing the proposed method for real-world applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The challenge of achieving sufficient coverage at the cell edge; represents a constant concern for both users and operators; in addition to ensuring a reasonable cost, are the most important search fields and in our scope of interest. As relay nodes can provide a solution, a scenario for a plan of relay nodes deployment at the cell edge is proposed, taking into account the interference due to the relay nodes. Since optimization algorithms are effective in terms of planning, an advanced hybrid particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA) is applied to the proposed scenario to detect the optimum solution. The optimum solution represents the optimum plan that attains the best coverage with the minimum cost. We submit cost analysis depends on three trails of construction cost, power and channel cost efficiency. To highlight that the optimal plan has been revealed, another recently developed optimization algorithm, a simplified adaptive bat algorithm based on frequency (FSABA) and a classic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are also applied to the suggested scenario. The obtained results are compared with the related findings of the PSOGSA. From the simulations, it is found that the PSOGSA achieves better performance than the other two algorithms with fruitful and promising results, and the optimal plan featuring great coverage at the cell edge and cost-saving is attained.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Managing this type of network is a challenging task. Clustering is a technique to efficiently manage resources in this type of network. In a cluster, all inter/intra cluster communication is managed by a cluster head (CH). Load on each CH, the lifetime of the cluster and the total number of clusters in a network are some parameters to measure the efficiency of the network. In this paper, a novel technique based on moth flame clustering algorithm for IoV (MFCA-IoV) is proposed. Moth flame optimizer is a nature-inspired algorithm. MFCA-IoV generates optimized clusters for robust transmission and is evaluated experimentally with renowned techniques. These techniques are Grey-Wolf-optimization-based method used for the clustering called as GWOCNETs, multi-objective particle-swarm-optimization (MOPSO), clustering algorithm based on Ant colony optimization for vehicular ad-hoc networks termed as CACONET and comprehensive learning particle-swarm-optimization (CLPSO). To assess the comparative efficiency of these algorithms, numerous experiments are performed. The parameters like network grid-size, number of nodes, speed, direction, and transmission-range of the nodes are considered for optimized clustering. The results indicate, MFCA-IoV is showing 73% nodes, which are not selected as a cluster head while existing techniques are providing 57%, 50%, 51%, and 58% for GWOCNETs, CLPSO, MOPSO, and CACONET, respectively. Hence, lesser the nodes are selected as CH, the more optimal result will be considered.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W.

To solve this problem, this paper envisions a novel concept named Traffic-Aware Multi-Tier Flying Network (TMFN). A TMFN consists of a mobile and physically reconfigurable network of Flying Mesh Access Points (FMAPs) and Gateways, which is able to dynamically reconfigure its topology according to the users' traffic demands - characterized by the users' positions and offered traffic. To implement this concept, a novel traffic-aware Network Planning (NetPlan) algorithm is proposed, which dynamically determines the FMAPs' coordinates and Wi-Fi cell ranges according to the users' traffic demands, in order to improve the TMFN's aggregate throughput, without compromising the overall coverage.

Most of fully autonomous UAVs navigation system is dependent on GNSS for localization. But the security threats that emanates from GPS system; spoofing and jamming makes the reliance on GNSS problematic. In this work, we proposed a fully autonomous UAV navigation system without GNSS and wireless communication. The application area of interest in this work is military battlefield. The proposed navigation method combines information gathered by Intelligence Preparation for Battlefield (IPB) and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance(ISR) group and onboard sensors. Then it applies AI-enabled multi sensor fusion, motion planning and decision making to accomplish the navigation successfully. The integrated way of navigation used to assess the conceptual possibility of autonomous navigation without the use of external navigation system and reliable operation of UAV at GPS and wireless signal denied environment. In addition, to ensure reliable operation of the navigation system, devices health monitoring system through the use of distributed monitoring agent and AI algorithms are proposed.

Nevertheless, it has hardly been considered until now. The communication systems for cubesats have to deal with a few peculiar demands regarding consumed power, geometry and throughput. Depending on the type of application, required data rates can go up to tens of megabits per second, while power consumption and physical size are limited by the platform. The proposed communication scheme will combine power-efficient modulation and channel coding with multiple access and spread spectrum techniques, enabling the deployment of multiple satellites. Apart from this, the antenna system has to be designed such that links can be established and maintained independent of the satellites' orientation. An electrically steerable radiation pattern is achieved by placing antennas on each face of the cube. Conformal beamforming provides the system with 5 dBi gain for any desired direction of transmission, eliminating the need for attitude control. Furthermore, using planar antennas reduces the complexity of the mechanical part as they require no deployment.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE Aerospace Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE Aerospace Conference</research-notes><custom3>2013 IEEE Aerospace Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V.

The overall cost (including price, weight, energy, etc.) of the payload required by some missions is sometimes too important to enable the robots of the swarm to embed all the required capabilities (i.e., sensors and actuators). This is the reason why it is more suitable to spread all the capabilities among the robots of the swarm. In this case, it is necessary to implement a collaborative system inside the swarm in order to share the capabilities among them. This collaborative system should provide task allocation as well as management of conflicts and failures which can occur at any moment. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative system for heterogeneous swarms of autonomous mobile robots called AMiRALE (Asynchronous Missions Relay for Autonomous and Lively Entities). Our system if fully distributed and relies only on asynchronous communications. We provide a formal description of our proposal based on a graph relabeling system. We also present experimental results obtained through both simulation and emulation. Our evaluation is based on a park cleaning scenario which relies on autonomous and specialized ground robots.  2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 International Conference on Protocol Engineering (ICPE) and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems (NTDS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: International Conference on Protocol Engineering, ICPE 2015 and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems, NTDS 2015, July 22, 2015 - July 24, 2015&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: International Conference on Protocol Engineering, ICPE 2015 and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems, NTDS 2015, July 22, 2015 - July 24, 2015</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NOTERE.2015.7293473</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Paris, France</custom1><custom3>International Conference on Protocol Engineering, ICPE 2015 and International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems, NTDS 2015, July 22, 2015 - July 24, 2015</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prateek</author><author>P.

We consider a network where a fleet of UAVs at a fixed altitude flies on planned trajectories and IoT devices on the ground are scheduled to transmit their data to the UAVs when the latter are nearby. In such a system, the UAVs' motion triggers the uplink transmissions of the IoT devices. As a result, network performance is determined by the geometric and dynamic characteristics of the system. We propose a joint stationary model for UAVs and IoT devices and then evaluate the interference, the coverage probability, and the data rate of the typical UAV. To assess the harvesting capability of the proposed architecture, we derive a formula for the amount of data uploaded from each IoT device to a UAV. We also establish a linear relationship between the UAV coverage and the harvesting capability of the network, which provides insights into the design of the proposed harvesting scheme. In addition, we use our analytical results to numerically show that there exists a trade-off between the uploaded data and the size of the IoT scheduling window. Specifically, for a given UAV and IoT geometry, there exists an optimal scheduling window that maximizes the harvesting capability of the proposed network.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

In this framework, the use of Ka-band for communication is explored. We present the design of a stacked patch antenna working across the down- and uplink Ka-bands. Materials and geometry of the radiator have been selected by accounting for the trade-off between electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical requirements. The design of the antenna is performed with a particle swarm optimization algorithm developed to control the bandwidth and matching. A bandwidth of 5.53@33.185 GHz has been obtained, with a gain around 8 dB. Furthermore, a multiphysics thermal analysis is performed to verify the operational stability of the optimized array, mounted on a 1 U satellite, in a case-study mission. The temperature patterns in the array are evaluated during the orbital period, and the influence of the operative temperature on the antenna responses and gain was considered. We found that the thermal loads can affect the antenna matching. However, thanks to the optimized design, the proposed stacked antenna can operate from −100 $^{\circ }$C to 100 $^{\circ }$C, with an almost constant gain. Finally, following a damage-tolerant approach, the level of mechanical deformation, which could be induced on the communication system, was studied. The stress analysis reveals that the stacked geometry can be used in a space mission. From the investigation of the strain and displacement field, we found a negligible impact on the antenna performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

One of these mechanisms consists to integrate simultaneously many criteria of quality of service (QoS) in routing decision. Efficient routing of information packets in dynamically changing communication network requires that as the load levels, traffic patterns and topology of the network change, the routing policy also adapts. We propose in this paper an approach used an adaptive algorithm for packet routing using reinforcement learning called AV-BW Delay Q- Routing. This approach is based on earlier developed K-Optimal path Q-Routing Algorithm (KOQRA) which optimizes simultaneously two additive QoS criteria: cumulative cost path and end-to-end delay. The approach developed here adds a third criterion to KOQRA regarding residual bandwidth. This proposed technique uses an inductive approach based on trial/error paradigm combined with swarm adaptive approaches. The whole algorithm uses a model combining both a stochastic planned pre-navigation for the exploration phase and a deterministic approach for the backward phase. Numerical results obtained with OPNET simulator for different levels of traffic's load show that AV-BW Delay Q-Routing improves clearly performances of our earlier KOQRA.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications</research-notes><custom3>2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.

The end-users are always demanding all kinds of network services including the time-critical and mission-critical ones. The Quality of Network Services (QoNS) of the future 5G and 6G networks are aiming to address all possible types of flexible user demands optimally. Telecom. Service Providers (TSPs) are rigorously looking for suitable network architectures that can assist them to realize such user-friendly systems. vSDN or virtualized Software Defined Network Architecture is the key technology enabler that makes such functionalities possible. In the recent paradigm shift where everything is being based on IoT, service availability and system stability are two major concerns. For keeping the quality index of the network services high, it is essential to orchestrate and deploy the network infrastructures that will provide additional and upgraded network services. Keeping these fundamental issues in mind, in this work, we have proposed a novel multi-instance deployment strategy for Controllers and Hypervisors over an actual network topology. While defining the work, our prime concern targets improving service availability within the ULL (Ultra-Low Latency) environment. Thus, we have developed a Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem for optimally placing the hypervisors and controllers over the network topology to minimize the H-plane service agreements along with propagation latency of network function demands. After analyzing the results, it can be claimed that our approach has a significant impact in improving the QoS of network parameters. The proposed model can be applied in similar time-critical relocation problems associated with UAV-assisted networks depending upon various application domains.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)</research-notes><custom3>IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.

As a critical component of the aviation swarm, the airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communications capability, enabling information sharing between both manned and unmanned military aircrafts as well as surface and ground platforms. The deficiencies of legacy ATNs, particularly their inability to meet the communications demands of the aviation swarm, motivated us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm to the ATN and to design an SDN-enabled ATN (SD-ATN) for the aviation swarm. For the SDN paradigm, the communications efficiency between the control plane and the data plane directly impacts the normal operations of the network, raising a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN, which is that how to ensure the QoS requirements of the non-elastic information transmitted between the control plane and the data plane (non-elastic C/D information) is met. To address this issue, a transmission framework is first proposed to make it practical to provide dedicated QoS guarantee for the non-elastic C/D information. Then, a communication protocol is designed based on the proposed framework, aiming at transmitting the non-elastic C/D information in a reliable and real-time manner. The simulation results show that, in the aviation environment, our scheme does improve the transmission efficiency of the non-elastic C/D information, which performs better than legacy solutions. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: S.

For the automated control of such a microrobotic system with small size and large population, conventional methods using precise robot models and robot-robot communications lose effectiveness due to the complex locomotion of micro/nano agents in a swarm and difficult implementation of onboard actuators and sensors for individual motion control and motion feedback. This article proposes a statistics-based approach and reports the fully automated control of a swarm of paramagnetic nanoparticles including the swarm pattern formation, identification, tracking, motion control, and real-time distribution monitoring/control. By establishing the swarm statistics, collective behaviors of a nanoparticle swarm can be quantitatively analyzed by computers. Algorithms are designed based on the statistics to automatically generate and identify the vortex-like paramagnetic nanoparticle swarm (VPNS), which present robustness to the dose and initial distribution of the nanoparticle swarm. In order to robustly track a VPNS, a statistics-based tracking method is proposed, in which 500 boundary points of the VPNS are extracted and the VPNS distribution is optimally recognized. And, with the proposed gathering improvement control, experiments show that over 70% nanoparticles can be gathered in the VPNS. Furthermore, an automated motion control scheme for the VPNS is proposed which shows high-accuracy trajectory tracking performance (tracking error: &lt;; 5% body length). Besides, real-time monitoring of the distribution region/density and control of the distribution area for a nanoparticle swarm are also realized by using the statistics. Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method in automated control of paramagnetic nanoparticle swarms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D. -Y.

With the help of wireless energy transfer technology, electrical energy can be transfer from Wireless Charging Equipment (WCE) to the sensor nodes, providing a new paradigm to prolong the network lifetime. Existing research usually takes the periodical and deterministic charging approach, but ignore the limited energy of the WCE and the influences of non-deterministic factors such as topological changes and node failures, making them unsuitable for real networks. In this study, we aim to minimize the number of dead sensor nodes while maximizing energy utilization of WCE under the limited energy of the WCE. Furthermore, the Swarm Reinforcement Learning (SRL) method is firstly introduced to achieve the autonomous planning ability of WCE. Moreover, to solve the problem of insufficient search in existing SRL algorithm, we improve the SRL by firefly algorithm. And a novel charging algorithm, named Swarm Reinforcement Learning based on Firefly Algorithm (SRL-FA), is proposed for the on-demand charging architecture. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, SRL-FA is compared with the existing swarm reinforcement learning algorithms and classic on-demand charging algorithms in two network scenarios. The Extensive simulation shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve promising performance in energy utilization of WCE, charging success rate and other performance metrics.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

In traditional wireless sensor networks, data is transmitted in a multi-hop manner, which may cause the high data transmission delay and unbalanced traffic load. In this paper, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted IoT architecture is introduced, in which UAV is utilized to achieve low-latency and seamless-coverage acquisition of the sensing data. Furthermore, based on the recent advances on deep reinforcement learning algorithms, considering both data delay requirements and network energy consumption, a real-time flight path planning scheme of the UAV in the dynamic IoT sensor networks has been proposed based on dueling deep Q-network (DQN).

Compared with conventional centralized SDVNs, hybrid SDVNs combine the centralized control of SDVNs and self-organized distributed routing of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) to mitigate the burden on the central controller caused by the frequent uplink and downlink transmissions. Although a wide variety of routing protocols have been developed, existing protocols are designed for specific scenarios without considering flexibility and adaptivity in dynamic vehicular networks. To address this problem, we propose an efficient online sequential learning-based adaptive routing scheme, namely, Penicillium reproduction-based Online Learning Adaptive Routing scheme (POLAR) for hybrid SDVNs. By utilizing the computational power of edge servers, this scheme can dynamically select a routing strategy for a specific traffic scenario by learning the pattern from network traffic. Firstly, this paper applies Geohash to divide the large geographical area into multiple grids, which facilitates the collection and processing of real-time traffic data for regional management in controller. Secondly, a new Penicillium Reproduction Algorithm (PRA) with outstanding optimization capabilities is designed to improve the learning effectiveness of Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM). Finally, POLAR is deployed in control plane to generate decision-making model (i.e., routing policy). Based on the real-time featured data, this scheme can choose the optimal routing strategy for a specific area. Extensive simulation results show that POLAR is superior to a single traditional routing protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and latency.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S. -C.

In light of the need of network characterizations, we analyze the connected M2M network in the machine swarm of geometric random graph topology, including degree distribution, network diameter, and average distance (i.e., hops). Without the need of end-to-end information to escape catastrophic complexity, information dissemination appears an effective way in machine swarm. To fully understand practical data transportation, G/G/1 queuing network model is exploited to obtain average end-to-end delay and maximum achievable system throughput. Furthermore, as real applications may require dependable networking performance across the swarm, quality of service (QoS) along with large network diameter creates a new intellectual challenge. We extend the concept of small-world network to form shortcuts among data aggregators as infrastructure-swarm two-tier heterogeneous network architecture, then leverage the statistical concept of network control instead of precise network optimization, to innovatively achieve QoS guarantees. Simulation results further confirm the proposed heterogeneous network architecture to effectively control delay guarantees in a statistical way and to facilitate a new design paradigm in reliable M2M communications.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N.

There is significant interest in asteroids as evidenced by multiple completed and ongoing asteroid missions. However, these missions heavily rely on human oversight and Earth-based resources such as the NASA Deep Space Network. Such an approach is not sustainable in the long term due to cost and oversubscribed Earth-based resources. Furthermore, these missions typically utilize a single spacecraft that is slow to adapt to its environment due to light time delay and gaps in communication with the Earth. In contrast, ANS comprises multiple small spacecraft that operate autonomously after a brief ground-in-the-loop initialization. The spacecraft are equipped with low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) avionics including star trackers, short-range cameras, radio-frequency intersatellite links, and chip scale atomic clocks. The algorithmic framework developed in this paper utilizes the intersatellite links and images of the asteroid to simultaneously estimate the spacecraft states as well as the asteroid gravity field, shape, and rotational motion. This class of estimation problem is defined in this paper as simultaneous navigation and characterization (SNAC), which is a superset of simultaneous localization and mapping. The ANS SNAC framework consists of three novel modules: 1) multi-agent optical landmark tracking and 3D point reconstruction using stereovision, 2) state estimation through a computationally efficient and robust unscented Kalman filter, and 3) reconstruction of a global spherical harmonic shape model by leveraging a priori knowledge of the shape properties of small celestial bodies. This new framework is validated through the numerical simulation of three spacecraft orbiting the asteroid 433 Eros. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides autonomous and accurate SNAC in a safe manner without any a priori shape model and using only low SWaP-C avionics.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)</research-notes><custom3>2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The ISOC will allow superfast cross-links and will be a technology enabler for swarms and formation flying spacecraft. The ISOC under development features a truncated dodecahedron geometry that can hold an array of fast photodiode detectors and gimbal-less MEMS scanning mirrors. The main goals of the ISOC development include: 1) full sky coverage, 2) Gbps data rates and 3) the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous links. We have developed two omnidirectional communicator prototypes capable of full-duplex operation. We are using advanced single-mode laser diodes operating at 850 nm capable of producing hundreds of milliwatts of laser radiation. We are also employing MEMS-based beam steering mirrors, and fast PIN photodiodes to achieve long-range communications. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve full duplex operation at 1 Gbps data rates over 200 km and slightly lower data rates at longer distances. In this paper we describe the overall ISOC architecture and present the design tradeoffs for gigabit data-rate operation. We also present preliminary NRZ On-Off Keying communications simulation results obtained using our optical link budget model. The ISOC is ideally suited for crosslink communications among small spacecraft, especially for those forming a swarm and/or a constellation. Small spacecraft furnished with ISOC communications systems, should be able to communicate at gigabit per second rates over long distances. This data rate enhancement can allow real-time, global science measurements and/or ultra-high fidelity observations from tens or hundreds of Earth-orbiting satellites, or permit high-bandwidth, direct-to-earth communications for planetary missions. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: J.E.

Currently, VANETs are facing node management, security, and routing problems in V2V communication. Intelligent transportation systems have raised the research opportunity in routing, security, and mobility management in VANETs. One of the major challenges in VANETs is the optimization of routing for desired traffic scenarios. Traditional protocols such as Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), and Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV) are perfect for generic mobile nodes but do not fit for VANET due to the high and dynamic nature of vehicle movement. Similarly, swarm intelligence routing algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) routing techniques are partially successful for addressing optimized routing for sparse, dense, and realistic traffic network scenarios in VANET. Also, the majority of metaheuristics techniques suffer from premature convergence, being stuck in local optima, and poor convergence speed problems. Therefore, a Hybrid Genetic Firefly Algorithm-based Routing Protocol (HGFA) is proposed for faster communication in VANET. Features of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) are integrated with the Firefly algorithm and applied in VANET routing for both sparse and dense network scenarios. Extensive comparative analysis reveals that the proposed HGFA algorithm outperforms Firefly and PSO techniques with 0.77% and 0.55% of significance in dense network scenarios and 0.74% and 0.42% in sparse network scenarios, respectively.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

A multi-targets tracking algorithm based on task allocation consensus is proposed for UAVs to track multiple moving targets under the distributed control architecture in the limited communication range. This algorithm creates a distributed dynamic task allocation model using intermittent asynchronous communication principle to realize the sharing of observation information gathered by each UAV with fewer communications. In addition, this algorithm also makes it possible that multi-UAVs can plan tracking paths for multiple moving targets.

However, the limitation of AUVs' battery cannot support persistent services, which restricts AUVs' operating range and mission duration. In this paper, a mobile underwater charging solution is developed that can continuously recharge a swarm of AUVs by using a wireless mobile charger. Magnetic induction-based communication and wireless energy transfer are employed. This paper first shows that by using tri-axis coils, reliable wireless communication and wireless energy transfer without coil orientation losses can be obtained. After that, wireless communication, motion control, and wireless energy transfer are jointly designed for a swarm of mission-driven AUVs. In particular, optimal continuous motion controllers are developed for AUVs to avoid intra-swarm collisions and networking protocols are designed to optimally allocate resources for wireless communication and wireless energy transfer. The proposed approach can guide AUVs to their destinations, while maintaining wireless network integrity and maximizing wireless energy transfer efficiency, upon which the constraints on AUVs' batteries can be eliminated and cheaper and smaller AUVs can be employed for various underwater applications.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: H.

As objectives of these missions become more ambitious, there are still problems in increasing the number of communication windows, supporting multiple signals, and increasing data rates over reliable intersatellite and ground links to Earth. Also, there is a shortage of available frequencies in the 2 m and 70 cm bands due to rapid increase in the number of CubeSats orbiting the Earth - leading to further regulatory issues. Existing communication systems and radio signal processing Intellectual Property (IP) cores cannot fully address these challenges. One of the possible strategies to solve these issues is by equipping satellites with a Software Defined Radio (SDR). SDR is a key area to realise various software implementations which enable an adaptive and reconfigurable communication system without changing any hardware device or feature. This paper proposes a new SDR architecture which utilises a combination of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and field programmable Radio Frequency (RF) transceiver to solve back-end and front- end challenges and thereby enabling reception of multiple signals or satellites using single user equipment. © 2014 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 41; Conference name: 2014 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems, AHS 2014; Conference date: 14 July 2014 through 18 July 2014; Conference code: 107216&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc.

In this scenario, Cooperative Multi-Robot / Multi-Sensor systems represent a new generation of ICT systems [1] [2], where mobile physical agents, equipped with sensors and/or actuators, may replace human operators in performing tasks in hazardous or risky environments. In this scenario, the Center for TeleInFrastruktur (CTIF) Italy, with its headquarter at University of Rome "Tor Vergata", and the Italian Company, Space Software Italia (SSI), have realized a device that allows to mobile physical agents to perform operations within a spatial-temporal area defined by mission data. Such a device is enough small to be easily integrated within physical agents.

The heterogeneous collaboration between UAS swarm enhances the complexity and the efficiency of mission complement that requires robustness, flexibility, and sustainability of throughput in UAS swarm networking. The conventional approaches mainly are based on the hierarchical architectures that are limited to satisfy the challenges of UAS swarm with high dynamics on a large scale. In this paper, we propose an optimal cell wall paradigm to enhance the throughput in heterogeneous UAS swarm networking. With the weight adjustment of each link, we map the optimization into a polyhedron scheduling problem and formula the problem into Max-min Throughput Fair Scheduling (MTFS). Further, we propose a max-min throughput algorithm to optimize the minimum throughput of cell wall paradigm. With the optimal max-min throughput, we optimize the schedule with edge-coloring to achieve global MTFS solving. The normalized MTFS shows our algorithm can achieve over 40% improvement of MTFS globally. In terms of MTFS solving, our algorithms have promising potential to improve the throughput and mitigate the incidents for multiple beams enabling of UAS in cell wall communication. With the throughput enhancement, the advanced aerial mobility of UAS swarm networking can be escalated on a large scale. © 2000-2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: H.

In order to effectively remove irrelevant or redundant features, the use of feature selection methods can reduce the number of features, improve the accuracy of the model, and reduce the running time. In recent years, Wrapper-based feature selection algorithms have received widespread attention because they can obtain better accuracy. This paper uses a wrapper feature selection algorithm FS_SSA based on Salp swarm. In the FS_SSA algorithm, the position of the follower salps is updated by the relative position of the Salp. The followers gradually moves to the leading Salp. The gradual movement of the follower salps can make the Salp Swarm Algorithm not easy to fall into a local optimal state. The two behaviors of exploration and development in subset searches are balanced, and the search process of feature subsets is prevented from falling into the local optimum. Experimental results based on public medical data sets show that the FS_SSA has better classification performance than other methods.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Information Communication and Software Engineering (ICICSE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Information Communication and Software Engineering (ICICSE)</research-notes><custom3>2021 IEEE International Conference on Information Communication and Software Engineering (ICICSE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Z.

In order to address this problem, we propose Mobile Intelligent Fog Computing: An Energy-efficient Cross-layer-sensing Clustering Method (ECCM). The first, according to the cross-layer projection principle, the proposed algorithm employs the sensing-event-driven mechanism to project the fog nodes onto the sensing layer, and constructs a powerful virtual control node. Then the control procedure of the cluster-based routing protocol in sensor networks is uploaded to the fog layer and the fog computation is employed to achieve the distributed clustering of the event-field nodes. The second, the optimized data aggregation routing is constructed, which centers the projectile fog nodes. The data in the bottom-layer routing of the sensor network is thus replaced, and the network load is balanced and reduced. The third, in the optimization of the routing protocol, we introduce the Particles Swarm Optimization, (PSO) algorithm and elect a group of optimal nodes as the cluster heads, without the cost of any competition overhead, the energy overhead of the network can be effectively reduced and balanced, which curbs the rapid exhaustion of the node energy and prolongs the network lifetime. Finally, it is shown by the simulation results that the construction and the maintenance of the routing structure are small, which could optimize the data aggregation efficiency and improve the network performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

In this paper, a sidelobe suppression approach (JSSA) to suppress the maximum SLL by jointly optimizing the locations and amplitude weights of the nodes is proposed. JSSA organizes the node positions according to the concentric circular antenna array for location optimization. Then, a novel algorithm called variation particle chicken swarm optimization (VPCSO) is proposed to further optimize the amplitude weights of the selected CB nodes. The proposed VPCSO introduces the variation mechanism and location learning mechanism to enhance the performance of the conventional chicken swarm optimization algorithm. Simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed location optimization approach is effective, and the maximum SLLs of beam patterns obtained by VPCSO are lower than that of other algorithms. Moreover, the energy consumption can be saved by VPCSO. In addition, electromagnetic (EM) simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed JSSA in EM environments.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M. -C.

It consists of a driven strip monopole and several parallel near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) strips that reside on the surfaces of a hemispherical shell. The monopole strip lies on the interior surface; the NFRP strips lie on the exterior one. This arrangement facilitates the requisite stable near-field capacitive coupling between them over a wide frequency range. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to define the lengths and locations of these NFRP strips to achieve its optimized operational bandwidth around 700 MHz given its compact size. The hemispherical shell was 3-D printed with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin; the strips were applied to it with silver paste. This prototype was tested. The measured results, in agreement with their simulated values, demonstrate that it achieves a 17.97% −10 dB fractional impedance bandwidth over which stable realized gain values, near 3.5 dBi, are attained.

Twitter is a social service where users may update their friends and followers with short messages called “tweets.” This paper's goal is to provide a technique for mining Twitter for sentiments. Based on the sentiment expressed, a tweet might be seen as good, neutral, or negative. The personal character of tweets makes traditional clustering methods impractical, making metaheuristic-based methods the best option. To measure the efficiency of the planned technique, we use two datasets: sender2 and tweeter. Several prominent nature-inspired methods, including Spider-Monkey optimization, Particle-Swarm algorithm, Genetic-Algorithm, and degree of difference Evolution, are compared with the conventional method to determine its validity. This is done so that the legitimacy of the suggested technique can be assessed.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 Second International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Intelligent Control, Environment, Computing &amp; Communication Engineering (ICATIECE)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 Second International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Intelligent Control, Environment, Computing &amp; Communication Engineering (ICATIECE)</research-notes><custom3>2022 Second International Conference on Advanced Technologies in Intelligent Control, Environment, Computing &amp; Communication Engineering (ICATIECE)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Mobile applications require different services when they enter or exit environments and as their resources change. In this paper, we propose a service oriented architectural approach that supports self-adaptation to changes in resources and location topology when mobility occurs, by reconfiguring the software architecture at runtime. The location topology and mobility primitives are inspired from ambient calculus. Our approach considers ambients to be autonomic elements that can manage elements located in them to their environment and provide them with new services suited to the available resources, when mobility occurs. Ambients implement a hierarchical and decentralized MAPE-K loop to adapt the distributed and mobile service oriented architecture to the resource requirements. We have designed an algorithm based on swarm optimization technique in order to allow ambients to optimally plan the reconfiguration process according to available services and resources. Throughout the paper, we use a scenario to illustrate our approach and perform initial evaluations on the swarm algorithm.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services</research-notes><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F.

Furthermore, they can also have a significant role in the creation of future Quantum Networks (QNs). As a matter of fact, the use of drones allows deploying a non terrestrial Quantum Metropolitan Area Network (QMAN), overcoming Optical Fibers’ (OFs) limits, due to the large percentage of photons that scatters before reaching the receiver. However, random fluctuations of drones’ positions and atmospheric turbulence can affect the quality of the Free Space Optic (FSO) link with a significant impact on performance. Considering that Quantum Drone Networks (QDNs) require significant control, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm can play a key role in their provisioning. Specifically, an SDN Controller is responsible for managing the global strategies for the distribution of end-to-end (E2E) entangled pairs. Therefore, this paper provides the design of an SDN-based architecture for supporting high-performance Metropolitan Quantum Drone Networks (MQDNs) with a specific protocol for creating entanglement between two Ground Stations (GSs) through the swarm of drones. The proposed architecture can be employed for distributed quantum computing applications and entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) services. Moreover, a suited objective function to optimize the planning and operation of the swarm mission has been proposed. Finally, the paper provides a performance evaluation considering the most relevant metrics, such as fidelity, entanglement rate, and the overhead of the proposed protocol, pointing out that even higher performance than OFs is achievable.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Resilience of traditional monolithic spacecraft is achieved mainly through redundancy, which exponentially increases the complexity of their production, and therefore, their cost. One solution would be to use fragmented spacecraft systems. Redundancy is achieved by nature with local complexity. Furthermore, scalability of such a system is facilitated. However, data transfer and physical communication link between the 'fragments' must be addressed. The main challenge of these systems is the management of the network of satellites. Traditional centralised networks, managed by a single entity, have been proven not to be secure, as they generate a common point of failure, susceptible to attacks. Traditional distributed networks, managed by multiple entities, require honest participants and trust between entities, restricting collaborative mission applications. In the present article, a design for a blockchain-enabled swarm fractionated system managed by multiple trustless entities is proposed. The system is composed of functionally different nano-satellites which perform tasks from different subsystems in order to replicate the functionalities of a monolithic spacecraft. The blockchain nodes are deployed in the satellites and allow sharing of sensor data between the network. A consensus protocol ensures the validity of the shared data. The proposed system has been implemented and evaluated on a local blockchain composed of four Ethereum nodes. We believe that the proposed application opens the way to new collaborative missions between entirely trustless parties, ensuring transparency and cooperation within the system. © 2022 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2022; Conference date: 5 March 2022 through 12 March 2022; Conference code: 181782&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2022, March 5, 2022 - March 12, 2022&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Aerosp.

We aim to improve the battery lifetime of the drone with the smallest energy among the drone swarms. In addition, we analyze the success, collision, and idle probabilities of the swarming drone networks. In particular, we analyze the intradrone swarm collision and interdrone swarm collision probabilities. Through intensive simulations, we show that the proposed RE-ORA scheme outperforms the conventional algorithm with respect to the average lifetime of drone swarms and successful packet transmission probability according to the number of drones and the residual energy.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is a channel access mechanism based on OFDM multi-carriers modulation technology. In OFDMA, multiple users can make use of the orthogonality of the subchannels to simultaneously access channel for parallel transmission. For underwater multi-hop network scenario, this paper proposes a MAC protocol of the joint relay selection and power allocation (JRSPA-MAC) based on OFDMA mechanism. The proposed protocol is divided into flowing phases: Firstly, the node determines the hop distance from the sink nodes and sends the request when there are packets to be sent. Then forwarding nodes election algorithm is proposed based on the channel condition and the delay information. On this basis, the sending nodes autonomously use the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to allocate its subchannels' power. Secondly, taking advantage of the high underwater acoustic propagation delay, the receiving node reasonably schedule the sending time, makes sure the parallel communication of multiple pairs of nodes in one handshake period. Finally, the destination nodes and the forwarding nodes acknowledge the received packets and completes this data transmission. The simulation results show that compared with the hand-shake based MAC protocols, the JRSPA-MAC reduces the probability of packet loss caused by data conflicts between nodes. In case of low power consumption, the network throughput are effectively improved, and the average end-to-end delay of the network is reduced.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yangmin Li</author><author>Xin Chen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Leader-formation navigation with sensor constraints</title><secondary-title>2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition</full-title></periodical><pages>6 pp.</pages><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>27 June-3 July 2005</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICIA.2005.1635150</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In case of a group of robots keeping certain shape passing through a special environment, members of the robots must change their relative positions in formation in order to avoid obstacles or to resume a predetermined formation shape after passing by.

Therefore, to realize formation under sensor constraints, we propose a local control strategy which ensures the formation converge to the predetermined formation pattern even if interaction topologies are dynamic.

The challenge is integrating these systems quickly and reliably with efficient payload operations. While much work has been completed to define and make flight control and operations available as open systems, fewer options exist for instrumentation. Some options are available for specific domains. For example, ROS (Robot Operating System) is used for many UAV (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle) projects, but interdisciplinary use cases are non-trivial for projects that migrate payloads between UAVs and CubeSats or coordinate UAV and CubeSat joint missions. Common objectives and careful flight and ground configuration for both UAVs and CubeSats could provide a Common Instrument Stack Architecture (CISA). Many of the basic instrument integration objectives for CubeSats and sUAS share common requirements. The goal for the research architectures we are investigating, is to compare combinations of stack layers including: 1) the use of open source real-time operating systems (RTOS), such as FreeRTOS and Linux with real-time extensions, with 2) open middleware, such as ROS, cFS (core Flight System) or F Prime, and 3) image co-processing firmware. Previously developed and tested FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and GP-GPU (General Purpose Graphics Processing Units) firmware for sUAS sensor networks will be integrated with CISA for performance testing. Ideally, we envision this architecture working for sensor networked flight instruments (sUAS and CubeSat) as well as ground systems (e.g. sUAS traffic management and CubeSat ground operations). To start, we are installing and evaluating the leading open-source middleware options in use for both UAVs and CubeSats integrated with our multi-core, GP-GPU, DPS, and FPGA image processing use cases to assess throughput, memory, I/O, storage, and power consumption. Our intent is to evaluate the relative merits of the underlying hardware architecture by running our prototype CISA (Common Instrument System Architecture) on off-the-shelf multi-core, GP-GPU, and FPGA SoCs (Systems-on-Chip) that have flown or are proposed for space flight, are in use with UAVs and provide best power efficiency and performance. This reference CISA stack composed of an SoC, operating system, co-processing, and middleware is hypothesized to allow future projects to migrate instrumentation and sensor payloads from UAVs to CubeSats easily and efficiently. Migration would provide continuity and scaling for research and science missions as well as joint operations. Along with objective metrics such as power and performance, the project is evaluating subjective metrics such as simplicity of integration, configuration, and interfacing common sensors.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100)</research-notes><custom3>2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.

This paper introduces a novel cognitive communications system that can be fielded on small attributable platforms; the architecture amalgamates a highly capable environmentally perceptive aperture, a software defined radio, and sophisticated networking techniques. The proposed cognitive communications system uses the 5G new radio waveform and applies groundbreaking machine learning methods to facilitate systems orchestration amongst its subsystems to transfer information effectively between nodes, and across large-scale multi-hop networks, essential for rapid strike missions. With the challenges imposed by mature and readily available jammers, a cognitive communications system can be used to maintain and sustain continuous communications to provide near real-time surveillance and situational awareness updates. In addition to describing the comprehensive cognitive communications system architecture, a jamming analysis will be presented. Performance results for an operational use case will be compared to existing trite architectures consisting of siloed apertures and standard radio systems to demonstrate an improvement of approximately 10 dB in communications margin with the auspicious technology offering of the cognitive communications system for low size, weight, and power attributable platforms.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

More recently there has been effort to expand the role of the cognitive engine to address the needs of a network of cognitive radios [4,5]. Haykin [6] has demonstrated that there is a significant difference between a network of cognitive radios and a cognitive radio network. This paper addresses three questions: 1. What are the significant functional and parametric differences between cognitive algorithms that deal with optimizing the operations of a cognitive radio and cognitive algorithms that optimize the operations of a cognitive radio network? 2. What are the trade-offs in applying the various algorithms to each task? 3. Which algorithms are optimal for the networking tasks? This paper identifies a set of parameters that characterize candidate algorithms and explores the benefits and drawbacks of each for cognitive network tasks. We propose a tiered architecture of cognitive engine algorithms that work in tandem to optimize the use of cognitive networked radios for the optimal success of the networked mission. © 2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: J.

The Slocum glider is a buoyancy driven AUV designed for missions that can last weeks or even months. Although successful, its hardware and layered control architecture is rather limited and difficult to program. Due to limits in its hardware and software infrastructure, the Slocum glider is not able to change its behavior based on sensor readings while underwater. In this paper, we discuss a new programming architecture for AUVs like the Slocum. We present a new model that allows marine scientists to express AUV missions at a higher level of abstraction, leaving low-level software and hardware details to the compiler and runtime system. The Slocum glider is used as an illustration of how our programming architecture can be implemented within an existing system. The Slocum's new framework consists of an event driven, finite state machine model, a corresponding compiler and runtime system, and a hardware platform that interacts with the glider's existing hardware infrastructure. The new programming architecture is able to implement changes in glider behavior in response to sensor readings while submerged. This crucial capability will enable advanced glider behaviors such as underwater communication and swarming. Experimental results based on simulation and actual glider deployments off the coast of New Jersey show the expressiveness and effectiveness of our prototype implementation.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</research-notes><custom3>2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

This gland helps in the production of seminal fluid which is used to nourish and transport the sperm. One of the most common types of cancer in men is prostate cancer. A microarray dataset contains the microarray gene expression information. On a genome wide scale, gene expression profiles make it easy to analyze the patterns between genes and cancers, however the analysis of gene expression data is very difficult as it has a high dimensionality and low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, a transformation-based Tri-level feature selection using wavelets for prostate cancer classification has been proposed. For the input microarray data, initially wavelets are applied and then the essential features are selected. Then the standardized gene selection techniques are implemented such as Relief-F, Fishers Score, Information Gain and SNR for a second level feature selection stage. Finally, before proceeding to classification, a third level feature selection by means of optimization techniques are implemented. The optimization techniques incorporated in this work are Marriage in Honey Bee Optimization Algorithm (MHBOA), Migrating Birds Optimization Algorithm (MBOA), Salp Swarm Optimization Algorithm (SSOA) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). This kind of an approach is totally new, and the best results show when SNR with WOA is classified with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) giving a classification accuracy of 99.48%. The second highest classification accuracy of 99.22% is obtained when Relief-F test with MBOA is classified with Naïve Bayesian Classifier (NBC).</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.

In this paper, we consider the sum of all these devices as one emerging system (the swarm) and present an approach of a swarm operating system that on a systemic level manages these devices (local devices give up their autonomy) while providing a common interface to user applications. We provide a programming model for distributed mobile applications that abstracts from error-prone aspects such as distribution and concurrency by giving the programmer a systemic view to system resources. The model allows the programmer to define actions that can be restricted in space and time. Together with a high level goal, an entire application emerges implicitly based on those defined actions. In order to execute such applications, we present an architecture for a runtime system that uses virtualization techniques in order to execute multiple independently developed applications in parallel. The system follows a service-oriented architecture: one of the core services is the space-time scheduler that plans applications (a set of actions) in time and space.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks</research-notes><custom3>2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

They are robust against failures and introduce diversity in the case of poor conditions. Cameras are used both for data acquisition and navigation. Additional sensors also play a role in the SLAM tasks (Simultaneously Localization and Mapping). The independent mobility of the robots/cameras leads to a situation in which the common field-of-view (FOV) of cameras changes continuously. The present paper addresses the task of acquiring and tracking the cameras FOVs. State-of-the-art FOV characterization techniques count feature points or do image segmentation. These methods are often not accurate or complex. We propose an adaptive common FOV detection method based on fuzzy plane clustering. The performance of the method is shown to be invariant under baseline scaling. An autonomous grouping algorithm is further proposed with respect to both distance of robots and overlapping FOV of cameras.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</research-notes><custom3>2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>W.

These networks exhibit a rule-based architecture while each rule in the FWN consists of the premise part and consequence part. The premise part is realized by using C-means clustering method, while the consequence part is realized by means of wavelet functions whose parameters are estimated with the aid of the least square method. In some sense, the FWPNN can be regarded as a generalized fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN). Unlike Gaussian membership functions that are commonly utilized to implement the premise part of the rules in typical FWNNs, C-means method is employed here to overcome a possible curse of dimensionality. Polynomial neural networks (PNNs) are used to express the nonlinearity of a complex system. Furthermore, the particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the design parameters of the proposed network. Based on the PNNs and FWNNs, the proposed FWPNNs take advantages of these two neural networks: it exhibits the abilities to describe high-order nonlinear relations between input and output variables and it is beneficial to describe models impacted by uncertainty. The proposed FWPNNs are applied for time-series prediction and regression problems (e.g., control of dynamic plants). Several well-known modeling benchmarks including regression and time series are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed FWPNNs. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed FWPNNs result in better performance when comparing with some previous models reported in the literature.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

Laboratory simulation for testing of medium to large UAS is attractive for managing overall program expenses and for removing the constraints on test execution. The benign dynamics of typical UAS along with the availability of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) scene generation software with good terrain datasets allows the Gray Eagle Modeling, Navigation, and Integration (GEMNI) laboratory and the U.S. Army Product Office for Medium Altitude Endurance (PM-MAE) to pursue a low-cost approach using a high-end desktop Windows simulator. The capabilities and limitations of this approach will be discussed. A general simulator architecture will be presented for the generation of synthetic video to model typical electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) fixed or gimbaled payload sources in applications where UAS are flying in standard airspace over mapped regions of land and at distances such that the map data resolution limitations are not significant. In the simulator architecture, a high-performance multi-core Windows desktop simulator is used to model the dynamics of the gimbal, emulate the software loaded on the sensor for controls, and host platform communications at rates of up to 512 Hz. Hard real-time simulation constraints and timing are allocated to hardware. The simulator interacts with the aircraft six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) simulator, the GEMNI Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) testbed, and the aircraft avionics data busses. COTS scene-generation software continues to improve as desktop computing and graphics technologies improve in performance and as the fidelity of data for Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) improves. Innovations such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED) provide substantial improvements over Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) datasets for vertical accuracy of GIS. Improvements in desktop computer storage capacity and the utilization of commercial drones equipped with high resolution cameras and lidar/radar is also allowing the usage of high resolution terrain maps in GIS. With these improvements in available data and technology, it is possible to design EO/IR sensor simulators that support the operational envelope of UAS for visual navigation applications over a wide geographical area without the need for a lot of site-specific GIS data collection and processing. An error analysis will be presented showing the coupling between the UAS performance and operating envelope to the GIS data quality and simulation timing errors. To accurately predict visual navigation performance in the laboratory environment, the sensor model itself must be accurate. With modern sensors now incorporating inertial sensors and doing master/slave transfer alignment from the aircraft platform as a way to improve their own navigation solution, these processes must be accurately modeled in the simulation. The error modeling approach will be discussed along with plans to perform model verification and validation (V&amp;V). Simulation development efforts also benefit from DoD and industry standardization initiatives. UAS designs are increasingly standardizing their datalink and video products around North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB), and Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) standards. The Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI) is a standard that is finding increasing support within COTS/ Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) scene generator developers. Thus, any sensor simulation supporting CIGI will have some options for which scene generator to use for graphics rendering.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</research-notes><custom3>2018 IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Therefore, power utilities are concerned about resolving the issue of electricity theft. In this regard, the data collected by Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) can be used to devise data-driven machine learning-based Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods. In this paper, a novel data-driven ETD method is proposed that firstly labels the electricity consumers as fair or malicious based on three analyses: intra-consumer, inter-consumer, and temperature-electricity consumption relation. After assigning labels to the data, significant features are extraction from data by introducing a new feature extractor that is based on Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) and sparse auto-encoder. Finally, classification is performed using two newly proposed enhanced classifiers, named as Differential Evolution (DE) Random Undersampling Boosting (DE-RUSBoost) and Jaya-RUSBoost. The performance of RUSBoost is enhanced using two nature-inspired swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithms, namely DE and Jaya optimization. The performance evaluation of the proposed classifiers is performed by conducting comprehensive simulations on real-world data taken from the UMass* smart homes electricity consumption dataset and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) electricity theft dataset. DE-RUSBoost achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89 and Jaya-RUSBoost achieves AUC of 0.95. The proposed classifiers have superior performance compared to two state-of-the-art benchmarks, i.e., Wide And Deep Convolution Neural Network (WADCNN) and grid search-based RUSBoost.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B.

There are primarily two reasons behind this development: the elimination of infrastructure support and the self-scaling property of P2P systems. The success of our system Coolstreaming represented one of the earliest large-scale P2P video streaming experiments. Since then, there have been several large-scale commercial deployments. With desirable content, these systems have the potential to scale orders of magnitude beyond the existing academic P2P prototypes. However, to transform this potential into reality, we need to understand the key design trade-offs and principles, as well as the design limitations of these systems. There are two main design decisions in a P2P streaming system: (i) How to form an overlay, and (ii) How to deliver the content. Coolstreaming adopts a gossiping protocol for overlay construction, and a swarm-based protocol for content delivery. While these protocols provide excellent flexibility and effectiveness in dealing with system dynamics and random failure, their impact on the performance and the system scalability remain less known. This paper takes an inside look at a commercial system based on the Coolstreaming, called Coolstreaming+. We explore its design choices and the impact of these choices on streaming performance. Specifically, by using internal traces generated by recent live broadcast events, we study the workload, performance, and dynamics of the system. Based on these traces, we show that (1) the churn is the most critical factor that affects the overall performance of the system, and (2) there is a highly skew resource distribution in P2P streaming systems, which has significant impact on resource allocation. We further discuss the impact of these observations on the system properties, and present solutions to deal with various design challenges. In particular, we suggest solutions to deal with the excessive start-up time and high failure rates during flash crowd, which are two of the main challenges any streaming system needs to address.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Under varying loads, the ability to tune the controllers of PMSM drives using optimal tuning time is crucial. However, direct tuning of controller parameters using estimated parameters or conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods do not satisfy the performance criteria. To solve this problem, the new method combining mechanical parameter estimation (MPE) and multi-layer particle swarm optimization (MLPSO) with K-means clustering (KMC) and an adaptive learning strategy (ALS) is proposed. First, the combination of an MPE method with a lookup table (LUT) for initial parameter selection is introduced to reduce the iteration time. Then, the MLPSO-KMCALS method is proposed as an improvement over the conventional PSO method by increasing the number of layers, grouping the swarm into several subswarms, and using the ALS for each particle to increase the population diversity and optimize the controller parameters within the shortest possible amount of time. Finally, a disturbance load torque observer is applied to compensate for the effect of external disturbances after tuning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments conducted under practical conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

To handle mobility, the MWSN node should be much more efficient than the nodes in static WSN. Moreover, a MWSN node should be capable of handling real time mobility control, path planning and navigation. The application domains of MWSN can be further expanded by incorporating swarm like intelligence in MWSN. We have developed a low cost, small form factor hardware platform which will function as a node in MWSN using custom off the shelf(COTS) products. Our mobile hardware platform, henceforth called as BSwarm robot supports self-assembly, to achieve complex tasks. The platform also support image assisted navigation and provides extensive I/O support for further feature expansion. The testbed consisting of multiple BSwarm robot can be utilized for the development and validation of algorithms/protocols related to MWSNs, distributed control of Swarm robots, real time image processing etc. BSwarm robot is a multi processor based robot designed in such a way that it can be used for applications which may demand varied degree of processing, communication and input-output capabilities. This paper also highlights major factors that can be taken into consideration while choosing the hardware platform for MWSNs so that the protocol stack development for MWSNs becomes easier. © 2015 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems, SPICES 2015; Conference date: 19 February 2015 through 21 February 2015; Conference code: 112047&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems (SPICES)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems, SPICES 2015, February 19, 2015 - February 21, 2015&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, INFORMATICS, COMMUNICATION AND ENERGY SYSTEMS (SPICES)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Int.

For this new 3D architecture, a tractable model for aBSs' deployment based on the binomial-Delaunay tetrahedralization is developed, which ensures seamless coverage for a given space. In addition, a versatile and practical frequency allocation scheme is designed to eliminate the inter-cell interference effectively. Based on this model, performance metrics including the achievable data rate and coverage probability are derived for two types of aUEs: i) the general aUE (i.e., an aUE having distinct distances from its serving aBSs) and ii) the worst-case aUE (i.e., an aUE having equal distances from its serving aBSs). Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach emphatically outperforms the conventional binomial-Voronoi tessellation without CoMP. Insightfully, it provides a similar performance to the binomial-Voronoi tessellation which utilizes the conventional CoMP scheme; yet, introducing a considerably reduced computational complexity and backhaul/ signaling overhead.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has traditionally launched single spacecraft missions that are served by the Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) program. Operations on SCaN networks are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and often each asset serves a single user spacecraft at a time. Recent movement towards swarm missions could make the current approach unsustainable. Additionally, the integration of commercial communication service providers will substantially increase the data transfer options available to new missions. NASA science missions have found benefit in launching swarms of spacecraft, allowing coordinated simultaneous observations from different perspectives. Inter-spacecraft communication (mesh networking) is an enabler for this architecture, as are CubeSats that allow cost-effective provisioning of distributed mission assets. As more complex swarm missions launch, one challenge is coordinating communication within the swarm and choosing the appropriate mechanism for telemetry, tracking, control, and data services to and from Earth. Cognitive communications research conducted by SCaN aims to mitigate the increasing communication complexity for mission users by increasing the autonomy of links, networks, and service scheduling. By considering automation techniques including recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, cognitive algorithms and related approaches enable increased mission science return, improved resource utilization for service provider networks, and resiliency in unpredictable or unplanned environments. The Cognitive Communications Project at the NASA Glenn Research Center develops applications of data-driven, nondeterministic methods to improve the autonomy of space communication. The project emphasizes the development of decentralized space networks with artificial intelligence agents optimizing communication link throughput, data routing, and system-wide asset management. This chapter discusses the objectives, approaches, and opportunities of the research to address growing needs of the space communications community. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

In an IoT-based system, WSN monitors different physical objects and forwards the collected data to the base station or gateway node for further processing. Existing routing protocols designed for WSNs are not suitable for IoT-based systems. An intelligent and high-performance routing protocol is essential for real-time data analysis and decision-making. Therefore, this paper proposes a mobile sink-based intelligent data routing scheme for WSNs. Initially, Particle Swarm Optimization is used for optimal cluster formation. After cluster formation, the optimal number of rendezvous points are selected, and a data-gathering tour is planned for the mobile sink. Furthermore, a mobile sink-based intelligent data gathering scheme is proposed to collect the data from the cluster heads. Extensive simulations and mathematical analysis are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The simulation results are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of stability period, network lifetime, throughput, average energy consumption, fairness index, data transmission latency, and message overhead.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

To mitigate the effect of these failures, fault tolerance becomes imperative. Nonetheless, it remains to be a second tier activity-it should not undermine the execution of the mission oriented tasks of WSNs through overly taxing their resources. We define architecture for fault tolerance in WSNs that is based on a federation of mobile agents that is used both for diagnostic intelligence and repair regimen, focusing on being lightweight in energy, communication and resources. Mobile agents are classified here as local, metropolitan, and global, providing fault tolerance at node, network and functional levels. Interactions between mobile agents are inspired by honey bee dance language that builds on semantics of errors classification and their demographic distribution. Our quantitative modeling substantiates that the proposed fault tolerance framework mandates minimalist communication through contextualized bee-inspired interactions, achieving adaptive sensitivity, and hysteresis-based stability. © 2010 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: S.

However, the centralized control plane architecture of SDNs makes them vulnerable to harmful security threats. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud (SecSDN-cloud) architecture that includes user authentication, routing, attack resistance, and third-party monitoring. The goal of this paper is to design an SDN-cloud environment with integrated security that can resist three different attack types: flow table overloading, control plane saturation, and Byzantine attacks. A novel digital signature with chaotic secure hashing is used for user authentication, followed by an enhanced particle swarm optimization multi-class routing protocol to improve the quality of service. Controllers are assigned to switches by integrating an enhanced genetic algorithm with a modified cuckoo search algorithm. The malicious flow identification includes the analysis of five-tuples constructed from features extracted from packets. We implemented the proposed SecSDN-cloud in the OMNeT++ simulator and evaluated its performance in terms of packet loss, end-to-end delay, throughput, latency, and bandwidth.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

SwarmOS features transaction-based spatio-temporal programming of mobile robot swarms on a systemic level. We show the programming model and resource management in SwarmOS. Swarm applications consist of concurrent, distributed and context-aware actions. We provide distributed transactions in order to guarantee atomic execution of a set of dependent actions. We distinguish between schedulability and executability of a set of actions: the first one is checked by the space-time scheduler which is a core service of the execution environment. The scheduler plans actions in space and time and computes spatio-temporal trajectories if robot movement is necessary. In order to guarantee executability of a distributed transaction of spatio-temporal actions, we present the concept of path alternatives and a time-based two-phase commit protocol in order to assure consistency. We show the feasibility of our approach by performing experiments on our testbed.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 11th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 11th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)</research-notes><custom3>2015 11th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

Many applications use already these platforms such as for homecare, industrial logistics, etc. and most of the time with in vicinity of humans, within dynamic and unknown environments. This poses the problem of adaptability and safety: robots should adapt to support a wide range of human users behaviors, with a strong guaranty of users' safety. In addition, such functions should take place with environments that are dynamic and not known a priori. This contribution reports on the mobile manipulator we are developing. We focus on solving the safe path planning problem for both the robot base and the robot manipulator in the presence of humans and dynamic obstacles: a safety distance should be strictly maintained by the robot with regard to the person involved in the interactive task as well as with any other person or moving object potentially colliding with the robot while performing the assigned task. These two requirements are achieved in real time by a multi-objective optimization that controls the base and the manipulator based on the task definition and the sensing data provided by the embedded sensors. Simulated scenarios have been tested and the obtained results are presented and discussed.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE Workshop on Robotic Intelligence in Informationally Structured Space (RiiSS)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2013 IEEE Workshop on Robotic Intelligence in Informationally Structured Space (RiiSS)</research-notes><custom3>2013 IEEE Workshop on Robotic Intelligence in Informationally Structured Space (RiiSS)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

Devices in the overlay network such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are required to provide coverage to underlay devices as well as remain connected to other overlay devices to exploit device-to-device (D2D) communication. The coordination, planning, and design of such overlay networks constrained by the underlay devices is a challenging problem. Existing frameworks for placement of UAVs do not consider the lack of backhaul connectivity and the need for D2D communication. Furthermore, they ignore the dynamical aspects of connectivity in such networks which presents additional challenges. For instance, the connectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the network, e.g., the mobility of underlay devices or unavailability of overlay devices due to failure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work proposes a feedback based adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework for the overlay network that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network to provide reliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Results show that the proposed framework requires significantly lower number of aerial base stations to provide higher coverage and connectivity to remotely deployed mobile devices as compared to existing approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

A novel condition monitoring method for WT planetary gearbox is proposed in this article. This method can identify and predict the fault in the initial stage. Raw vibration signals are gathered from WT planetary gearbox through an enhanced piezoelectric self-powered wireless sensor. First, after the data processing back-end receives the original samples transmitted by the wireless sensor, the high-dimensional raw vibration signals are compressed and collected by adopting a random Bernoulli matrix to obtain the compressed samples containing the characteristics of the raw signals by compressed sensing (CS). Moreover, the operation of reducing the signal dimension not only eliminates noise pollution but also greatly reduces the overall calculation. Second, the training part of compressed samples is first exploited to optimize the deep belief network (DBN) by the chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization (CQPSO) algorithm. In the optimization process, the CQPSO algorithm can avoid local optimal problem better compared with traditional quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, which ensures that the optimized DBN architecture can extract distinguishing and deep features from compressed samples. Furthermore, the choice of compression ratio (CR) is realized in this process with the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) classifier. Third, testing samples are input into the DBN structure. A regression layer added on the last hidden layer, which stores extracted features, achieves the prediction of fault. In addition, LSSVM is exploited to distinguish fault types of features. The experimental results show that the modified wireless sensor can collect and transmit signals stably and achieve better performance in transmission interval and energy management. More importantly, the experimental results of prediction and diagnosis show that the proposed approach achieves excellent performance in terms of condition monitoring for the WT planetary gearbox.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

However, an efficient and reliable data routing decision scheme is critical for VANETs due to the feature of self-organizing wireless multi-hop communication. Compared with wireless networks, which are unstable and have limited bandwidth, wired networks normally provide longer transmission distances, higher network speeds and greater reliability. To address this problem, this paper proposes a reliable VANET routing decision scheme based on the Manhattan mobility model, which considers the integration of roadside units (RSUs) into wireless and wired modes for data transmission and routing optimization. First, the problems of frequently moving vehicles and network connectivity are analyzed based on road networks and the motion information of vehicle nodes. Second, an improved greedy algorithm for vehicle wireless communication is used for network optimization, and a wired RSU network is also applied. In addition, routing decision analysis is carried out in accordance with the probabilistic model for various transmission ranges by checking the connectivity among vehicles and RSUs. Finally, comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method can support real-time planning and improve network transmission performance compared with other baseline protocol approaches in terms of several metrics, including package delivery ratio, time delay and wireless hops.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D. -Y.

One of the most distinguishing features of FANET is frequent and rapid topological fluctuations due to the high-mobility of UAVs. Hence, the topology management adapting to the movements of UAVs is one of the most critical issues in FANET. In this paper, we study a FANET topology management problem that optimizes the locations and movements of UAVs to maximize the network performance, adapting to the topological changes while UAVs carry out their missions. When formulating the problem, we take into account the routing protocol as an arbitrary function since the network performance is inseparably linked with the routing protocol in use. We first develop two algorithms. One is the topology construction algorithm, which constructs a FANET topology from the scratch without any given initial topology, based on particle swarm optimization. The other is the topology adjustment algorithm, which incrementally adjusts the FANET topology adapting to the movements of UAVs with low-computational costs, based on gradient descent. Then, by defining a logical distance (the so-called topology edit distance) that measures the degree of changes in FANET topology, we develop an integrated topology management algorithm that contains the topology construction and adjustment algorithms. The simulation results show that our algorithm achieves a good network performance with low computational overhead, which is one of the most essential virtues in FANETs with rapidly varying topology.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N.

Rational planning of the quantity and positions of the chargers provide an effective way to improve the recharging efficiency and save the charger deployment budget. Existing work on RF-based charger placement mainly considers the situation where the devices are static, or adopt very simple mobility model. In this paper, we consider wireless charging service provision for wearable devices worn by users in a two-dimensional area, with users having a specific stay-move behavior pattern characterized by the trajectories, stay points, and stay time distribution. Based on this mobility pattern, we formulate the problem as how to find a charger placement to minimize the charging service budget, subject to the power non-outage probability requirement of the wearable devices. We further transform this problem to several equivalent problems for easier tractability and prove that it is NP-complete. Both greedy heuristic and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based solutions are proposed to solve the problem with certain approximation ratio. Finally, performances of the proposed solutions are compared with exhaustive search and existing point provisioning algorithm through extensive simulations. Simulation results show that both greedy heuristic and PSO-based solutions outperform the baseline algorithms, while PSO-based solution requires least number of chargers and thus is the most cost-effective.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The design of the antenna is performed with a numerical optimization, to control the bandwidth and the impedance matching. A bandwidth of 5.53@33.185 GHz has been obtained, with a gain around 8 dB. On this design, a multiphysics thermal and mechanical analysis is performed to verify the operational stability of the optimized antenna, mounted on a 1U CubeSat satellite. The analysis verified that the antenna temperature patterns can affect the antenna matching, but it still allows correct operation in the [−100° C,100° C] temperature range. Moreover, the stress analysis reports a level of mechanical deformation which does not compromise the use and functioning of the proposed stacked geometry in a Low Earth Orbit space mission.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 16th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2022 16th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)</research-notes><custom3>2022 16th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Through the integration of satellite networks and terrestrial networks, it can provide a better user experience and has become the core development direction of 6G networks. Inspired by the potential of service differentiation ability of 6G IEEE 802.11ax protocols (Wi-Fi 6), a Data-driven Fair-Hierarchical Scheduling (DFHS) is proposed in this paper to schedule packets from diversified applications in dense Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which allows data streams to fairly share the spectrum and at the same time satisfy delay requirements. Our DFHS is divided into the outer-layer and inner-layer schedulers. First, diversified packets of IoT services are classified into categories according to delay requirement and transmission frequency. Then the outer-layer scheduler assigns classified packets to different Access Categories (AC) with differentiated channel competition capabilities. Next, the inner-layer scheduler optimally schedules the AC queues according to the packet access response ratio. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is further introduced to solve the optimal packet scheduling problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the DFHS outperforms the classical FCFS, the latest EARS and Tian's schemes in terms of service missing ratio, queueing delay and fair index.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Service-level guarantees that are achievable in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can ensure reliability, availability and overall usability in any application. SOA can be useful in providing needed capabilities for the military in the traditional needs of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, information, surveillance and reconnaissance (often called C4I2SR). Military capabilities such as joint capability, interworking capability, COTS, organization agility, swarming, situational awareness and faster decision making are common applications that can benefit from SOA capabilities and each requires a certain level of quality to be successful. SOA provides the ability to dynamically locate and execute services within a composite function plan to achieve the desired QoS. A composite function plan is a template (blueprint) used to create a composite service. How to create the necessary structure in a military WSN is still a research topic to achieve the required levels of quality of service. We present a strategy that uses dynamic service selection to achieve higher levels in quality of service for WSNs, while preserving network lifetime. The realization of these strategies will be achieved through a SOA middleware layer in the WSN.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference</research-notes><custom3>2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dae-Ki Cho</author><author>Chia-Wei Chang</author><author>Min-Hsieh Tsai</author><author>Mario Gerla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Networked medical monitoring in the battlefield</title><secondary-title>MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference</full-title></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>16-19 Nov. 2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2155-7586</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753145</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With critical data gathered during the battlefields, commanders are able to generate more plans and make better decisions more swiftly. Providing up-to-minute medical information such as physical and psychological fitness of each soldier can significantly help these decisions. The most of current medical information gathering system is in a format of speech or text. To collect this data with mobile devices and to propagate it to the commander, an efficient data transferring, low-power consumption, secure and light-weighted solution is needed. Previous solutions for on-site medical diagnosing and data gathering with portable devices did not address data transfer protocol, security and power-saving issues. In this paper, we propose to extend those local solutions to a dynamically changing, geographically distributed scenario using the battlefield soldier monitoring system (B-SMS). B-SMS is based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). With the P2P protocol, soldiers within a team opportunistically share their medical records. Soldier P2P communications can be via Bluetooth. The P2P network then elects a peer to upload the information to UAVs using wireless channels such as 802.11 or WiMax equivalents. The UAVs then convey the information to the commander either via multi-hop UA V to UAV communications, or in a delay tolerant mode, by ferrying the data to destination. To validate the proposed P2P + UAV solution, we study via simulation the data dissemination within the unit and the transfer to the base camp through UAVs. The B-SMS system will have the dual purpose of allowing the commander to re-organize combat groups based on physical conditions, and; the medics to prioritize medical intervention, thereby protecting soldiers lives, and supporting commanders strategic decisions. The time requirements of these tasks may differ. In this paper, we will also evaluate P2P delays and UAV transfer delays and discuss their impact on the applications.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference</research-notes><custom3>MILCOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

To achieve highly efficient resource utilization in SDN and offer users with diverse service requirements, virtual network embedding (VNE), which maps various virtual network requests of users to a given substrate network, should be conducted. In this paper, we study the VNE problem in SDN where the substrate SDN switches and links may be subject to malicious attacks. We first propose a hierarchical virtualization-enabled SDN architecture based on which the VNE strategy can be designed. Then, stressing the importance of network load and reliability of the substrate network, we formulate the VNE problem of SDN as a multi-objective optimization problem which jointly minimizes network load and maximizes embedding reliability under the constraints of virtual network requirements and the resource characteristics of substrate network. As the formulated optimization problem is a complicated multi-objective optimization problem which cannot be solved conveniently, we apply the ideal point method. In particular, we first propose virtual node embedding sub-algorithm and virtual link embedding sub-algorithm to determine the locally optimal solution to the two subproblems, i.e., network load minimization subproblem and embedding reliability maximization subproblem. Then, examining the distance between the feasible solutions and the locally optimal solutions, we formulate a single-objective optimization problem and solve the problem to obtain the global VNE strategy by applying discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

The proposed  $e$ AP system controls the energy resources of IoT devices to extend the lifetime of the IoT device. For this purpose, we develop a new  $e$ AP system that considers a cross-layer design with a prompt TCP ACK transmit function, a caching-and-retransmit IoT data function, and a multiple IoT data aggregate function to improve the energy efficiency of the IoT device. In addition, the proposed  $e$ AP system has a device energy management module that precisely controls operating parameters, such as the transmission period of IoT packets, the delivery of traffic indication message (DTIM) value of IoT devices, and the transmitting power of IoT devices. These features extend the lifetime of the battery-powered IoT devices while satisfying service requirements for reliable IoT services. The long listening time of TCP ACK messages in receive mode (Rx) results in the high energy consumption of IoT devices due to the large round trip time. The proposed  $e$ AP system reduces the reception time of TCP ACK messages in the IoT device, using the prompt TCP ACK transmit function in the  $e$ AP. This reduces the long Rx mode time for TCP ACK reception, and increases the short sleep mode time, which results in increase of the energy efficiency of the IoT device. In the energy-saving analyses, we formulate an energy consumption model for the IoT device, and determine the energy-saving gain when the IoT device uses the  $e$ AP system model, compared to a legacy AP system model. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed  $e$ AP system achieves a maximum improvement in energy efficiency of approximately 88%, and 8.4 times improvement in the expected lifetime of the IoT device, compared to the legacy AP system model.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M. de Kok</author><author>J.

The polymorphic control systems (PCS) project formalizes constructs that permits topological reconfiguration of control systems that span multiple heterogeneous systems and multiple communication mediums, towards the goal of control coordination and strategy optimization in a multi-system environment, increased resilience to failure and uncertainty, increased overall and individual performance, and better utilization of available resources. This paper presents the concepts behind PCS, and presents results from a flight test experiment involving distributed reconfiguration of an autonomous landing controller in a collaborative multi-vehicle environment.

Innovative methodologies and applications able to unlock such a huge potential are required. A domain where MCS really fits is mobility and transportation. However, for a full exploitation of this paradigm in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), distributed and self-management capabilities for the involved nodes-vehicles have to be provided. This paper is a first step in this direction, laying out an optimization system by exploiting feedback-driven patterns in a distributed-opportunistic way. In this sense, collective intelligence and stigmergic, swarm-based paradigms are adapted to an innovative decentralized MCS pattern toward new approaches in ITS. Their effectiveness is demonstrated through a traffic engineering case study, where route planning services are designed according to the proposed approach and then modeled and evaluated by Markovian agents.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

In the field of communication techniques for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAVs use sensors to upload collected data to cloud servers during various exploration activities, but UAVs can only store and calculate valid information currently collected due to the limited storage and computing performance. In the actual exploration, UAVs need not only to upload complete data to the cloud server, but also to support the data dynamic update efficiently. Moreover, due to security requirements, the privacy of data uploaded by UAVs must be protected. However, the existing auditing schemes for dynamic data and integrity have many problems, such as high computation cost, low efficiency of dynamic update, low privacy and security. For this reason, we propose a public cloud audit scheme that supports dynamic data and privacy protection based on distributed string equality check protocol and Merkle-hash tree multi-level index structure. First of all, a third-party server (TPS) is set between the cloud service provider and users, which complete digital signature, integrity auditing, and data dynamic operations significantly in place of users to reduce the local computing cost. Users then locally upload data which has been encrypted to the TPS. Secondly, to further improve the security of the scheme, TPS implement signature for encrypted data based on the distributed string equality check protocol. By designing authorizations with time constraints, it is guaranteed that only the legitimate TPS with time constraints can operate with cloud servers. Finally, we implement dynamic data operation efficiently based on MHT multi-level index structure. The security proof and performance analysis show that our proposed scheme is safe and effective.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>U.

Meta-heuristic algorithms for feature selection have good exploration capability for optimal discriminative feature selection for fault isolation/classification of which the Binary Particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is superior to its counterparts. This study presents a robust approach for vibration-based failure diagnostics of electromagnetic/solenoid pumps which employ a multi-domain feature extraction procedure (statistical time-domain and frequency-domain features, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, and continuous wavelet coefficients) for capturing linear and nonlinear properties from the signals. Compared with other filter and wrapper methods for supervised feature selection, a hybrid filter-wrapper (Pearson's correlation-BPSO (ρ-BPSO)) feature selection procedure is proposed for global search of optimal discriminative (uncorrelated) features for fault diagnosis with an RBF-kernel support vector machine (SVM*). Subsequently, a practical case study involving five VSC63A5 solenoid pumps at various operating/fault conditions is presented for validating the performance of the proposed approach. Results show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid filter-wrapper approach against filter-based and wrapper-based techniques for discriminative feature selection. Also, the proposed ρ-BPSO-SVM* diagnostics model performance was compared with other standard fault isolation/classification methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hsiao-Ming Chang</author><author>Fei-Hsuan Liao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A study of development model for leisure agricultural farm localization</title><secondary-title>2011 IEEE International Summer Conference of Asia Pacific Business Innovation and Technology Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2011 IEEE International Summer Conference of Asia Pacific Business Innovation and Technology Management</full-title></periodical><pages>338-340</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>10-12 July 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/APBITM.2011.5996351</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In recent years, recreation farms have been blooming.

Leveraging a cognitive radio (CR) scheme is discussed as key point of the paper, arguing that by exploiting in an opportunistic fashion the time, frequency and spatial stream of the wireless environment, increased communication reliability can be achieved with positive impact on the availability and service level at each hierarchical level. The application of CR, given the heterogeneous nature of the application across multiple radio interfaces and protocols, stand outs as a novel and feasible research direction. We argument the advantages of this scheme within the constraints of a working scenario and define a simulation-based approach in order to validate our solution.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 2014 6th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proceedings of the 2014 6th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)</research-notes><custom3>Proceedings of the 2014 6th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fuqing Zhao</author><author>Qiuyu Zhang</author><author>Yahong Yang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multi-agent model for the order driven agile manufacturing systems and order form selection algorithm</title><secondary-title>2009 International Conference on Information and Automation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2009 International Conference on Information and Automation</full-title></periodical><pages>1625-1630</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>22-24 June 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICINFA.2009.5205177</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The manufacturing industry is entering a stage of change which is driven by the competitive environment of continuous and unpredictable events.

To correct the lens distortion, existing methods use prior information, such as calibration patterns or lens design specifications. However, the use of a calibration pattern works only when an input scene is a 2-D plane at a prespecified position. On the other hand, the lens design specifications can be understood only by optical experts. To solve these problems, we present a novel image-based algorithm that corrects the geometric distortion. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: i) feature detection, ii) distortion parameter estimation, and iii) selection of the optimally corrected image out of multiple corrected candidates. The proposed method can automatically select the optimal amount of correction for a fisheye lens distortion by analyzing characteristics of the distorted image using neither prespecified lens design parameters nor calibration patterns. Furthermore, our method performs not only on-line correction by using facial landmark points, but also off-line correction described in subsection III-C. As a result, the proposed method can be applied to a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) camera with two fisheye lenses in a field-of-view (FOV) of 195°, autonomous vehicle vision systems, wide-area visual surveillance systems, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cameras.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

Then a smart system is needed to detect threats and deal with them. In this paper, we propose a system structure composed of a central agent and three layers: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) layer, multirobot layer and sensor network layer. The UAVs act as moving sensors and conveyors in the air. They provide the overall rough monitoring data from the air and transport robots to the emergency occurring places. The robots on the ground are responsible for obtaining detailed monitoring data and dealing with the emergencies. The sensor networks keep monitoring the environment and assist robots and UAVs in the range to complete their tasks. The central agent can adjust the system according to the specific task requirements. We provide a general system design and review main required technologies, highlighting the challenges and some possible solutions.

GWO showed performance improvement over all competing algorithms. However, the relevant literature identified that the primary GWO due to its position update equation shows superiority in exploitation, but is inefficient in exploration. It shows slow convergence and low precision, too. Motivated by the outlined issues in the primary GWO, this work presents two new and improved GWO algorithms. The first proposed variant modifies all the three models, encircling model of prey, position update equation and the hunting equation of canonical GWO. Further, a new parameter is introduced to scale the encircling and position update equations. As a result, the exploration issue of the algorithm is tackled. Unlike the first variant, the second proposed variant does not modify the position update models, but it incorporates Minkowski’s information into GWO. To the best of our knowledge, no such modifications to GWO have been done before. The proposed modified versions of GWO are tested on a well-known test functions suit and then compared with different population-based algorithms, including fast evolutionary programming and particle swarm optimization. It was identified from the simulation results that proposed algorithms outperform different algorithms in comparison on majority of problems. The sensitivity study of the proposed algorithms to their various parameters is also provided.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.

For this purpose, a Local LSTM prediction model of each cluster is proposed in which the devices are clustered based on the features of the extracted data using an autoencoder. By adjusting the device transmission interval based on the prediction results, the amount of redundantly collected traffic in the LoRa environment is reduced. The proposed scheme is validated using a simulation-based experiment with the Intel lab IoT dataset. Here, we consider the physical characteristics of LoRa and the data pattern of Intel lab data. As a result, the scalability of the proposed scheme can be improved by 31% on average with a 0.3 MAPE prediction error threshold compared to the base model to which the proposed scheme is not applied.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Too many hidden layer nodes not only make the network more complex but also reduce the generalization ability of the algorithm. Aiming at this problem, an improved crow search algorithm is proposed to optimize the extreme learning machine. Based on the analysis of the limitations of the original crow search algorithm, a particle swarm algorithm search strategy is proposed to enhance the global search capability. In the latter part of the algorithm iteration, Gaussian function is added, and the penalty coefficient of the function is used for local disturbance, gradually reducing the amplitude of the search trajectory, and then adaptively adjusting the parameters to avoid being attracted by local extremum. Finally, the improved crow search algorithm is used to optimize the hidden layer neurons and connection weights of the extreme learning machine neural network, so as to obtain accurate prediction results. Through function fitting, regression data set fitting and classification data set for classification experiment verification, the proposed algorithm has higher training speed and efficiency. At the same time, this method is not only significantly higher than the traditional ELM method, but also obtains a more compact network structure, which is an effective neural network optimization algorithm.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jianqin Zhang</author><author>Zhijie Xu</author><author>Yanmin Wang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An intelligent traffic information service system based on agent and GIS-T</title><secondary-title>2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>2791-2794</pages><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>26-28 June 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/MACE.2010.5536501</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Advanced traffic information service system not only provide timely and accurate traffic information for traffic management personnel who can effectively adapt the traffic management control system to a variety of traffic conditions and road network capacity, but also help road users, effectively avoiding traffic jams, reducing traffic accidents.

Their use to enhance the provision of electricity enables the implementation of smart grids, where energy flows are closely combined with the provision of other energy-related information. The limited battery lifetime of the sensor nodes remains a prominent research challenge and limiting factor in WSN deployment. This paper proposes a joint constrained optimal sink placement and energy-efficient routing with the aim of extending the WSN's lifetime. The proposed solution is a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm that can be used for planning the deployment of WSNs in smart grids. The proposed algorithm involves a novel model of encoding the allowable sink locations into the PSO's particle-space. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to place the sink within the constrained areas while also improving the WSN's lifetime.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 International Conference on Advances in Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2018 International Conference on Advances in Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)</research-notes><custom3>2018 International Conference on Advances in Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L.

Although satellite remote sensing is an effective way for forest fire monitoring, satellite-based methods can only monitor large-scale forest areas, and they are weak in predicting the specific areas of forest fires. In this article, we first propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled system architecture consisting of multiple industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs), in which the data collected by sensors in IIoTs can be delivered to UAVs for processing directly. As the sensors of IIoTs are deployed to monitor different indexes of forest fires, fully considering the priority constraints among sensors can guarantee a quick response of forest fire monitoring. Thus, the priority constraints among the sensors are taken into consideration in this system architecture, and the objective is to minimize the maximum response time of forest fire monitoring. To search for the optimal UAV resource allocation strategy, a learning-based cooperative particle swarm optimization (LCPSO) algorithm with a Markov random field (MRF)-based decomposition strategy is proposed. The solution space of UAV resource allocation is decomposed into subsolution spaces according to the decomposed decision variables by the MRF network structure, and the optimal resource allocation strategy is searched by LCPSO in multiple subsolution spaces cooperatively. Three simulation experiments on two datasets are designed, and the simulation results compared with the state-of-the-art methods verify the validity of LCPSO, which are reflected by the quickest response time of forest fire monitoring.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.

The SiL was assisted by the Flight Variables Management System (FVMS), a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that fully interfaces communication between MSFS and general purpose custom GNC algorithms. The originality of this new approach is to make the FVMS communication layer completely transparent to the designer so that full attention may be focused exclusively on guidance algorithm development and the debugging process as well. Furthermore, the application may be extended to both multi-engine fixed and rotary wing aircraft. When it comes to the design, development and validation of brand new control algorithms of GNC for unmanned systems, SiL flight simulation becomes an exceedingly useful tool since end-product may misbehave in-flight. It impacts over avoiding hazard situation of crew and population in the ground and on preserving expensive equipment of being damaged. To illustrate FVMS capabilities and assets on GNC systems design, a nonlinear path following algorithm is set up. FVMS GNC module is endowed with a full map interface and a mission management through which one may build/rebuild the UAV path on-line. The results demonstrate the potential of the framework on the implementation of either simple or more complex solutions for the GNC problem.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 Joint Conference on Robotics: SBR-LARS Robotics Symposium and Robocontrol&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2014 Joint Conference on Robotics: SBR-LARS Robotics Symposium and Robocontrol</research-notes><custom3>2014 Joint Conference on Robotics: SBR-LARS Robotics Symposium and Robocontrol</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

The focus of this paper is to study the problem of information sharing and lower the communication overhead among different nodes for a specific data mining approach in distributed big data architectures. This problem can be abstracted as how to efficiently search under a specific cluster node topology. This paper proposes a new design rule for topologies including: 1) low coordination number; 2) high packing density; and 3) having a 3-D structure. According to this rule, a rhombic dodecahedron topology is proposed. A distributed banking big data mining framework based on the proposed topology is implemented. The experiments based on multioptimization benchmark functions show the excellent searching ability of the proposed topology; and a banking customer feature reduction prototype has been implemented to showcase the practicality of the data mining framework.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

By exploiting viable gathering of massive renewable energy data using the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes a framework for improved highway-energy management based on the unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted wireless energy re-distribution of the harvested renewable energy. Combining both massive low-rate sensing with high-speed 6G-envisioned transmission for data aggregation, the IoT architecture is of multi-scale, consisting of: i) global data exchange and analytics for energy mapping, re-distribution planning and forecasting, and ii) local data sensing and processing at individual highway lampposts for micro-energy management. The feasibility of the networked energy system is analyzed via analytical cost-reliability analyses. The cost analysis demonstrates the cost-effectiveness through the lowest Requirement of Energy and Cost of Energy for the setup and maintenance. The reliability analysis reveals the energy plus (E+) feature of the system in certain conditions with enhanced reliability in adverse weathers that impact energy generation.

The classification is based on information extracted from the network flow packets. This is a complex classification problem with unbalanced datasets and noisy data. This work extends the classic radial basis function (RBF) neural network by including it as a policy network in an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. With this approach, all parameters of the radial basis functions (along with the network weights) are learned end-to-end by gradient descent without external optimization. We further explore how additional dense hidden-layers, and the number of radial basis kernels influence the results. This novel approach is applied to five prominent intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, AWID, CICIDS2017 and CICDDOS2019) achieving better performance metrics than alternative state-of-the-art models. Each dataset provides different restrictions and challenges allowing a better validation of results. Analysis of the results shows that the proposed architectures are excellent candidates for designing classifiers with the constraints imposed by network intrusion detection. We discuss the importance of dataset imbalance and how the proposed methods may be critically important for unbalanced datasets.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H.

Feature selection deals with the selection of the most pertinent features that also aid to increase the classification accuracy. The topic of feature selection is viewed as a multiobjective optimization problem with two goals: improving the classification accuracy and reducing the number of features used. Drone Squadron Optimization (DSO) is one of the most recent artifact-inspired optimization algorithms; having two key components: semi-autonomous drones that hover over a terrain and a command center that manages the drones. In this paper, two binary variants of the DSO are proposed to deal with the feature selection problem. The proposed binary algorithms are applied on 21 different benchmark datasets with five state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Lion Optimization (ALO). Different assessment indicators are used to assess the diversification and intensification of the optimization algorithms. When compared to current state-of-the-art wrapper-based algorithms, the suggested binary techniques are more efficient in scanning the dimension space and picking the most useful characteristics for categorization tasks, resulting in the lowest classification error rate.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>E.

This warrants both, day-ahead planning of larger schedules for power plants, as well as short-term contracting to counter forecast deviations or to accommodate dynamics of the intra-day markets. In addition, the geographic distribution of renewable energy sources forces scheduling algorithms with a hugely different communication link qualities. In this paper, we present an extension to the Lightweight Power Exchange Protocol (LPEP), dubbed LPEP++. It draws on the strength of the LPEP to find the optimal solution of the combinatorial power demand-supply problem with string guarantees in acceptable time and extends it with facilities for long-term planning, parallel negotiations and reduces its memory footprint.

Those nodes suffer from limited processing capabilities as well as energy. They are also required to live for a long time; sensors send their data to the sink node through multi-hop routing. The sink node is responsible for making the appropriate decision based on the received data. This shows how critical the information fusion process at the sink node. Such fusion is affected by the quality of the collected information from the deployed sensors. In addition, information handling in the WSN is also affected by environmental conditions, sensors energy, and data reliability, which play important roles in the eminence of information fusion. This paper introduces an efficient environment-aware fusion-based reliable routing algorithm named E3AF. The algorithm takes different parameters into consideration, including environmental metrics, energy consumption balance among sensor nodes, and network and data reliability. The algorithm models the environment to allow the routing algorithm to avoid going through areas marked dangerous. The paper formulates the problem into an optimization problem, which is structured as an Integer Linear programming (ILP) to help grasp and obtain the optimum solution. Furthermore, the paper presents swarm intelligence as a heuristic algorithm when the optimal solution is not possible. In comparison to EFMRP, some of the used equations were corrected, and more realistic conditions and constraints were added. With extensive experiments, the proposed algorithm is evaluated and proved its efficiency.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

It is significantly necessary to obtain the safety-related transportation information of an area when vehicles are drove there, whether or not they are controlled by human being. However, vehicular content caching can bring issues in distributed-fashion, such as high response delay and low content response ratio because of the poor traffic condition and the obstructions of buildings. As a consequence, we adopt UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to assist the driving safety-related content caching for vehicles. Besides, since the power energy and the caching storage of UAVs are limited, it is needed to design an optimal caching scheme to guarantee the driving safety-related content demands of vehicle users as well as reduce the energy consumption of UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel deep Q-learning based air-assisted vehicular caching scheme to respond to the driving safety-related content requests of vehicle users. First, a three-layered content response architecture is introduced, where an airship is leveraged to take charge of the scheduling of UAVs to improve the content response. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is built to describe the specific problem of the proposed scheme. Finally, deep Q-learning is applied to solve the multi-objective problem by learning from the history content requests of vehicle users. Extensive experiments have been conducted which show the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of content hit ratio, response delay, being scheduling probability and packet buffering time.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.

The basic concept of the behavioral strategies lies in the imitation of natural swarms of social animals, like flocks of birds, which are characterized by a global group organization acquired in absence of a centralized control. In particular, an on-orbit self assembly manoeuvre is analyzed. Since every satellite takes its own decisions being able to consider only a small number of neighbor satellites and limited intercommunication, full autonomy is achieved. However optimality in terms of control cost and required time for complete self assembly is an issue which is not even taken in consideration. In this work, the behavioral results are compared with a typical centralized control, with an active leader which is able to detect the position and the dynamics of each swarm member and to compute the optimal guidance towards the fittest slot around the leader. In such a way, the optimality of the swarm manoeuvre is reached, at the cost of a great complication in the system architecture of the leader. Special attention will be dedicated to the filtering strategies, in particular to particle filters, apt to solve navigation problems including a large number of close members, when measurements ambiguity can occur. An extensive simulation campaign, for various orbit configurations and swarm dimensions, is performed in order to clearly assess and quantify the advantages and drawbacks of the behavioral and centralized strategies.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2009 IEEE Aerospace conference&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2009 IEEE Aerospace conference</research-notes><custom3>2009 IEEE Aerospace conference</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.

Based on the spatio-temporal correlation between multivariate time-series data, we developed a novel multivariate time-series data encoding scheme utilizing the proposed time-series distance measure  $\textit {ADMWD}$ . Composed of two significant factors for a multivariate time-series prediction, i.e., the absolute deviation from the mean (ADM) and the weighted differential (WD) distance, the  $\textit {ADMWD}$  considers both the time distance from a prediction point and a negative correlation between the time-series data concurrently. Utilizing the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a subset of IoT sensor readings can be predicted from encoded multivariate time-series measurements, and we compared the predicted sensor values with actual readings to obtain the adaptive data transmission period. Extensive performance evaluations show a substantial performance gain of the proposed algorithm in terms of the average power reduction ratio (approximately 12%) and average data reconstruction error (approximately 8.32% MAPE). Finally, this article also provides a practical implementation of the proposed PBATPC algorithm via the HTTP protocol under the IEEE 802.11-based WLAN network.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C.

Drones can self-organize into a connected swarm (Flying Ad Hoc Networks – FANETs) to complete various challenging missions. As the primary building block of Internet-of-Drones (IoD), FANETs have an important role to play in governing the autonomous movement of drones and supporting drone-to-everything (D2X) communications. However, factors such as flying characteristics and the highly dynamic topology of FANETs compound the challenges of packet forwarding; thus, the focus of this article. Specifically, a stochastic packet forwarding algorithm (hereafter referred to as SPA) is proposed for FANETs, where the data packets can be efficiently transferred to the destination. In SPA, the packet sender evaluates each next hop forwarding candidate drone based on different network metrics, prior to selecting the next hop forwarding drone according to the forwarding probability. In addition, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of SPA. Then, the link expiration time and link throughput are chosen as network metrics for network simulation experiments, where SPA is evaluated and compared with prior schemes (e.g, DTNgeo and GeoUAVs). The performance of SPA is evaluated in a real-world testbed to complement the network simulation experiments. Findings from the evaluations demonstrate that SPA obtains better performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet delivery latency, the number of delivered data packets, average link lifetime, and bit error rate. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The proposed FSRC scheme promotes relay operation with low spreading factor (SF) to improve the success probability for distant end-devices (EDs) and the fairness of success probability for each SF region. To achieve this, a theoretical framework for designing the relay operation is analytically developed by considering a practical LoRaWAN MAC protocol as an analytical model. The proposed FSRC scheme encompasses a selective relay operation by considering both signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio and the receive signal strength indicator value for the location-unaware relay selection strategy. Using this model, a genetic algorithm-based relay control strategy is proposed to maximize both coverage probability and minimum success probability for all SF regions by controlling the relay parameters, such as source-relay region and source-relay ratio. Our numerical analysis validates the effectiveness of the proposed FSRC scheme under various parameters in terms of the minimum success probability of each SF region, coverage probability, and fairness. Specifically, we verify that the proposed FSRC scheme achieves a maximum of approximately 37% and 33% improvement of the minimum success probability and coverage probability, respectively, under practical LoRa PHY/MAC parameters, compared to the single-hop environment (without relay operation).</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>X.

By focusing on the relative ranging performance, the wireless RF modules mounted on the cost-efficient UAVs are used to provide communication, ranging and positioning at the same time; however, its positioning accuracy is usually degraded by the noise in the actual RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) measurements. To solve this problem, we analyze the influence of antenna pattern inhomogeneity and channel variation, respectively. The former mainly determines an antenna radiation function related to the yaw angle and relative position between the two measuring UAVs. The latter uses overlapping Allan variance to analyze and identify the measurement noises from outfield tests, that is, quantization noise, flicker noise, random walk noise and Gaussian white noise, which to some extent bridges the difference between the theoretical model and the practical measurement of RSSI. We also evaluate the sub-swarm size that guarantees robustness of RSS-based localization. In this way, an improved extended Kalman filter is proposed to predict and correct the colored noise by adaptively integrating the current peer-to-peer radio ranging performance and its Allan variance. To prove the effectiveness of this approach, simulation results based on real environment datasets and practical noise modeling are demonstrated.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.

In this context, a crucial role is played by the so-called network reconfiguration problem, which aims at determining the optimal DN topology. This process is enabled by properly changing the close/open status of all available branch switches to form an admissible graph connecting network buses. The reconfiguration problem is typically modeled as an NP-hard combinatorial problem with a complex search space due to current and voltage constraints. Even though several metaheuristic algorithms have been used to obtain - without guarantees - the global optimal solution, searching for near-optimal solutions in reasonable time is still a research challenge for the DN reconfiguration problem. Facing this issue, this article proposes a novel effective optimization framework for the reconfiguration problem of modern DNs. The objective of reconfiguration is minimizing the overall power losses while ensuring an enhanced DN voltage profile. A multiple-step resolution procedure is then presented, where the recent Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm constitutes the core part. This optimizer is here intelligently accompanied by appropriate preprocessing (i.e., search space preparation and initial feasible population generation) and postprocessing (i.e., solution refinement) phases aimed at improving the search for near-optimal configurations. The effectiveness of the method is validated through numerical experiments on the IEEE 33-bus, the IEEE 85-bus systems, and an artificial 295-bus system under distributed generation and load variation. Finally, the performance of the proposed HHO-based approach is compared with two related metaheuristic techniques, namely the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the Cuckoo search algorithm. The results show that HHO outperforms the other two optimizers in terms of minimized power losses, enhanced voltage profile, and running time. Note to Practitioners - This article is motivated by the emerging need for effective network reconfiguration approaches in modern power distribution systems, including microgrids. The proposed metaheuristic optimization strategy allows the decision maker (i.e., the distribution system operator) to determine in reasonable time the optimal network topology, minimizing the overall power losses and considering the system operational requirements. The proposed optimization framework is generic and flexible, as it can be applied to different architectures both of large distribution networks (DNs) and microgrids, considering various types of system objectives and technical constraints. The presented strategy can be implemented in any decision support system or engineering software for power grids, providing decision makers with an effective information and communication technology tool for the optimal planning of the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of DNs.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 56; Correspondence Address: R.

It not only speeds up information transmission between people but also expands the scope of information exchange, which has become an essential and important social media in people's social life. How to effectively identify and classify these online communities has important practical significance for the study of social networks. Correctly detecting the community structure of mobile social networks can not only improve the accuracy of friend recommendation, link prediction, service user positioning, product marketing, and other aspects but also provide an important basis for the monitoring of online public opinion. But the traditional social network cluster method based on the trust degree mainly calculates the user trust by analyzing the interactive feedback information between users. This method cannot effectively solve the “cold start” problem in the trust calculation process, that is, for the new network node, the trust value of this node cannot be accurately measured due to the lack of interaction with other nodes. Focusing on this problem, we propose a Gaussian pigeon-oriented graph clustering algorithm for social networks' cluster in this paper. A graph model is first built. Then, an efficient K-medoid algorithm is utilized to search the user center in all groups. The Gaussian pigeon algorithm is used to search the similarity between each user and the central user. Users that meet the similarity threshold are divided into the same user group. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method has better cluster effect than other state-of-the-art social networks' clustering approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Y.

Steering is an extraordinarily selected network which is to an incredible degree testing as a result of its dynamic nature, compelled information transmission and power essentialness. Somehow, Swarm Intelligence based procedures, for instance, underground creepy crawly state optimization (ACO) algorithms have gave off an impression of being a better than average strategy for making directing algorithms for extraordinarily delegated networks. ACO based steering is a successful directing plan in light of the lead of seeking ants. Wireless Sensor Networks are portrayed by having specific essentials, for instance, compelled essentialness availability, low memory and decreased getting ready power. On the other hand, these networks have colossal potential importance, e.g., living space checking, restorative care, military perception or action control. Various traditions have been made for Wireless Sensor Networks that endeavor to overcome the objectives that portray this sort of networks.

As this technology develops and is deployed for missions in Low Earth Orbit and beyond, the use of delay tolerant networking (DTN) techniques may improve communication capabilities within the network. In this paper, a network hierarchy is developed from heterogeneous networks of SmallSats, surface vehicles, relay satellites and ground stations which form an integrated network. There is a trade-off between complexity, flexibility, and scalability of user defined schedules versus autonomous routing as the number of nodes in the network increases. To address these issues, this work proposes a machine learning classifier based on DTN routing metrics. A framework is developed which will allow for the use of several categories of machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest, and deep learning) to be applied to a dataset of historical network statistics, which allows for the evaluation of algorithm complexity versus performance to be explored. We develop the emulation of a hierarchical network, consisting of tens of nodes which form a cognitive network architecture. CORE (Common Open Research Emulator) is used to emulate the network using bundle protocol and DTN IP neighbor discovery. © 2019 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Conference name: 2019 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop, CCAAW 2019; Conference date: 25 June 2019 through 26 June 2019; Conference code: 155025&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 IEEE Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAAW)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IEEE Cogn.

However, the dynamic, complexity and openness of cloud computing bring unprecedented risks to the security and reliability of computing tasks. To solve the problem the new approach is presented. Firstly, the game theory is introduced into the delegating calculation, and the single-client and multi-server rational delegating calculation game model is given. Secondly, the Zero-determinant Strategy scheme based on delegating calculation is constructed through implementing the single-client and single-server rational delegating calculation protocol and Zero-determinant Strategy, and the conditions of the existence of Nash equilibrium of Zero-determinant Strategy is analyzed. Then, through the iterative implementation of the Zero-determinant Strategy, the participants will cooperate with each other actively. Finally, the performance analysis results show that the entrusting party can regulate the betrayers in the computing party through Zero-determinant Strategy to ensure the interests of honest people in cloud computing.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><titles><title>[Title page]</title><secondary-title>2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination</full-title></periodical><pages>1-1</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>31 March-2 April 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The following topics are dealt with: open dynamic distributed service architecture design; autonomous fault tolerant multi-robot coordination; object transportation; artificial immune system; acoustic head orientation estimation; powered wheelchair control; adaptive signal strength prediction; radio propagation models; multi-robot navigation strategies; omnidirectional mobile robots; distributive model predictive control; optoccupied poseable ball; underwater communication constraints; marine robot teams; swarm based construction; multi-pendulum synchronization; constrained agreement protocols; outdoor cooperative localization; cooperative robotic search; communication-aware target tracking; swarm pattern transformation; motion planning; mobile networks; graph-based distributed control; optimal multi-UAV convoy protection; swarm-capable autonomous agents; underwater sensor networks; UDP-based protocol; wireless Internet and distributed robot controllers.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination</research-notes><custom3>2009 Second International Conference on Robot Communication and Coordination</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><titles><title>[Front cover]</title><secondary-title>2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)</full-title></periodical><pages>c1-c1</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>8-9 Nov. 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/NTIC.2015.7368734</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The following topics are dealt with: MANET; target tracking; VANET; V2V communication; packet load enhancement; ad hoc routing protocol simulation; VolP traffic support; mobile ad hoc networks; path planning; fixed wing UAV formation; ARTI taxonomy; cyber-attack framework; enhancement optimized MAC protocol; block design multichannel MAC protocol; WSN; PAPR reduction; STBC MIMO-OFDM systems; 4G wireless communications; PTS scheme; SCADA open protocol PUR 2.4; smart walk mechanism; unstructured mobile P2P networks; BLE-based data collection system; Finger-Knuckle-print identification; SVM classifier; optimal object-oriented image classification; MLLH approach; image denoising algorithm; multireprsentation palmprint image; automatic personnel identification; optimized audio watermarking scheme; swarm intelligence; speech synthesis; Arabic language; model transformation; time-extended multirobot task allocation problem; Web applications; model-based approach; Chi-Square test; heuristic search; metamorphic malware detection; materialized view definition; semantic Web service; content-based dermoscopic image retrieval; and fuzzy labeled transitions system.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)</research-notes><custom3>2015 First International Conference on New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, L.-M.-D.</author><author>Vo, V.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the system performance for the Internet of Things (IoT) using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the disaster area. The communication protocol is separated into two phases: In the first phase, due to the resource limitation, UAV relays (URs) harvest energy from a ground power beacon (GPB) to support the communication process. In the second phase, the ground base station (GBS) sends the signal to the first UR by using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. It is noted that the first UR uses its energy harvested from the first phase to forward the signal to the second UR by applying the decode-and-forward (DF) approach. Similarly, the second UR uses DF to transfer the signal to two IoT sensor node (IoTS) clusters, i.e., near cluster and far cluster. Accordingly, we derive the closed-form expression of the throughput for the IoTSs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) with Nakagami-m fading and formulate a new problem of throughput optimization for multi-UAV system. For optimization problem, solutions are found using covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. The numerical results show that system performance in terms of throughput can be improved by tuning the UAVs’ altitudes and distances from the GBS to suitable values. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: V.-H.

The solar sailcraft will have to navigate for about a year and a half between a departure orbit at 50,000 km and the distance to the Moon at 400,000 km or more. It seems that LoRa technology can be used for this Earth-Moon mission and the question arises about the advantages and disadvantages of using this system, from an energy point of view, the budget link and also its potential use for future applications in expanding Earth-Moon operations. Components are available at accessible costs, possibly using the educational modular hardware proposed by Xinabox. The LoRa (Long Range) technology offers a very good reception sensitivity, and standards already exist worldwide. The drawback of very low throughput does not seem to be a problem in the context of the Earth-Moon Challenge and can positively contribute to reducing the energy needs for data transmission. The proprietary LoRa technology is based on the spectrum spread modulation technique. It was developed with the aim of reducing the consumption of sensor network nodes and is experiencing a strong development in the field of Internet objects (IoT). In low Earth orbit, many functional or deployed nanosats projects use LoRa technology. A compromise will be sought between consumption and the link balance in the different phases of the mission. In the vicinity of the Earth, the existence of LoRa telecommunication networks in orbit (Lacuna Space, Swarm Technologies, ...), offers the opportunity to test reception without need for tracking from the ground station. At greater distance, the ground monitoring station will be the reference unit. From the spread of the spectrum of communication signals, physical information and low-throughput data can be implemented and adapted for the specific Moon mission, and new hybrid modules have to be developed to interface with optical systems, cameras and star sensors, the service module that will take the sailcraft to the start orbit, mechanical devices for the deployment sequence, liquid crystal control surfaces, and interplanetary science payloads. Here we present the state of the art and potential to use LoRa for the Payankeu solar sailcraft and other missions in the Earth-Moon environment, for the goal to reduce costs - Yes we can !.

As a result, WSNs have been implemented to monitor animal care and track their health status. However, excessive energy utilization and communication traffic on packet transmissions lead to system deterioration, especially whenever perceived information captured in the monitoring area is transferred to the access point over multiple dynamic sinks. Further to manage the energy and data transmission issue, the energy consumption and location aware routing protocol has been architected on the wireless Nano sensor nodes. In this article, a novel hybrid energy and location aware routing protocol to cloud enabled IoT based Wireless Sensor Network towards animal health monitoring and tracking has been proposed. However proposed data routing protocol incorporates the trace file for path selection for data transmission to base station using sink node. Trace file has been obtained on processing the cluster heads established in the network. Therefore, clustering of node in the network has to be achieved using LEACH protocol which enhances the network scalability and network lifetime by clustering the nodes with Metaheuristics constraints like location or node density comparability. The objective of the proposed model is to enhance the network scalability and energy consumption by establishing the multiple node clusters with high density cluster head through Metaheuristics Node Clustering optimization techniques. Metaheuristics based node clustering is been obtained using Improved Particle Swarm Optimization. Further it is employed to compute the optimal path for sensed data transmission to base station. Node clustering provides high energy consumption among the sensing nodes and to establish the high energy clusters towards sensed information dissemination to base station on dynamically reforming the nodes clusters with respect to Node density and node location.

Aiming to solve the multi-task reconnaissance planning by multi-UAV, a novel distributed task planning method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a distributed contract network protocol is proposed to achieve task allocation for multi-UAV. Comparing with traditional method, the communication load is reduced and the allocation speed is improved. Afterwards, an improved PSO path planning is carried out to provide a feasible flying path to the target. The planning efficiency is increased via introducing chaotic map initialization and adaptive parameter adjustment. Finally, numerical simulations for multi-task reconnaissance mission are given. The results show the quick generation of task execution sequence and reconnaissance paths, and are also consistent with reconnaissance engineering applications. © 2022, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

Securing the communication taking place with the drones and especially in the network of a swarm, is of primary importance to allow a safe integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles into air traffic. Drones are subject to a range of attacks, from GPS jamming to application bug exploits. Among these attacks, and irrespective to whether they have already been implemented or not, communication is one of the main contributors, both as a vector and as a target. In this article, we use previous work on security threats concerning drones to identify two main types of attack in a network of drones: intrusion from the outside and network usage from inside. We demonstrate the robustness of the Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture facing most common attacks from the outside. In addition, we propose a traffic injection detection technique and corresponding countermeasures based on SDN flow counters. Finally, we present an innovative machine learning solution based on Random Forest Classifier to address insider attacks, relying solely on flow creation events. We propose two specific features that characterizes the activity in the network. They allow detecting common network attacks such as denial of service, port scanning and brute force and are easily available to the controller. Detection performance of these abnormal behaviors are promising, both in terms of true positive and false negative, and in terms of detection delay. Detection of these common attacks will allow tightening of security in such wireless network by denying further access to the network by rogue nodes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: C.

In order to reach the ambitious Mars exploration objectives set out for the coming decades, a significant reduction of cost, risk and schedule is needed. Additionally, many current science objectives, such as improving models of Martian weather and climate as well as internal structure, require long-term surface data over large areas of Mars. We propose a mission architecture based on a swarm of wind-driven rovers that can provide these types of observations, while also reducing high mission cost and risk for Martian exploration. Following mid-air deployment, the rovers unfold and touch down on the surface, roll across the surface until a desired spread of the rovers is achieved, and are then stopped. Scientific data is collected both on-the-roll and when stationary. The Tumbleweed mission provides a unique opportunity to characterize Mars using data over various spatial and temporal scales. We show that a Tumbleweed mission has high utility with respect to Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) Goal II (Climate on Mars) by providing environmental data including temperature, pressure and wind velocity. Goal III (Martian Geology) is addressed by providing highly precise geodetic data and assisting in gravimetric measurements. Moreover, Goal IV (Human Exploration) is fulfilled by surveying large surfaces of Mars, adding crucial context to the current understanding of the Martian environment. With a sensor package consisting of a radio beacon, laser retro-reflector, atmospheric sensors and a rudimentary camera the Tumbleweed mission can address objectives relating to all three aforementioned high-level MEPAG goals. While many aspects of the mission can rely on already-proven technology, further development is needed on a miniaturized location determination system, the folding mechanics of the rover structure, and the rover's power systems. To gain further insight, a half-scale demonstrator of the rover has been constructed and tested in a Mars analogous environment. The results of the test show the general feasibility of the rover and have provided validation of visual instruments. Moreover, a novel reversible, non-destructive method for arresting the rover through reefing sails has been demonstrated. Visual data can be used to further develop a locating algorithm. Another avenue for future research is the communication with the swarm of rolling rovers on the surface of Mars which warrants unique communication strategies.

To address the imbalance problem of network overhead and limited energy of underwater sensor nodes, this paper presents a CH–SH Selection and Sink Path-planning (CSSP) scheme to collect vast amount of data from heterogeneous sensor nodes. The scheme firstly establishes a three-layer network structure model for underwater mobile sensor networks (UMSN) based on multi-mode communication mechanism and provides energy-balanced head nodes (cluster head and sub-cluster head nodes) selection algorithm based on particle swarm iterative optimization. Then, the optimal global-path-plan of mobile sink is proposed to visit all the head nodes to collect data, reduce the multi-hop underwater acoustic transmission distance of relay nodes, and avoid the energy hole problem. Lastly, the upper-layer multi-hop network of UMSN is designed to remotely control local-path-plan over mobile sink, in order to implement joint planning of global and local paths of mobile sink. Simulation results verified that the proposed CSSP scheme outperformed 11%, 16% and 22% over three typical protocols in terms of nodes energy consumption, CSSP was 9%, 12% and 19% lower than three typical protocols in terms of SD of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio of CSSP was 8%, 10% and 12% higher than three typical protocols. The scheme could significantly balance energy and reduce packet loss rate. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: Y.

A key aspect of UAV swarms is keeping the UAVs connected through wireless communication and any deployment of UAV swarms must consider communication constraints during motion planning. In this paper we introduce \textit{ICCSwarm}, a framework for integrating communication and control in UAV swarms. \textit{ICCSwarm} consists of two phases, a planning phase where combined communication and motion planning are validated in simulation, and a deployment phase, where a UAV architecture designed around integrated communication and control executes missions from the planning phase on physical UAVs. We implemented \textit{ICCSwarm} on a physical UAV testbed and evaluated its effectiveness through a unique case study in partnership with NASA's JPL. We deployed the UAVs to trial small satellite orbits for data collection on asteroids and the results validate our design and highlight \textit{ICCSwarm}'s capabilities.  © 2022 ACM.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 7; Conference name: 8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications, DroNet 2022 - Part of MobiSys 2022; Conference code: 180584&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 8th Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications, DroNet 2022 - Part of MobiSys 2022, July 1, 2022&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: DroNet - Proc.

However, easy estimation of this key factor by traditional or experimental models is very difficult. This requires comparing available models for achieving the best prediction approach. In this study, four machine learning (ML) methods and two traditional ROP models were utilized to predict ROP. ML techniques include multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR). MLPNN, ANFIS, and RBFNN methods were trained with four meta-heuristic algorithms including particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA). The backpropagation (BP) algorithm was also incorporated to train the ANFIS and MLPNN methods as a conventional method. For comparison purposes, the traditional ROP models of Bourgoyne and Young (BYM) and Bingham were also implemented in combination with four meta-heuristic algorithms. The required data were collected from the mud logging unit (MLU) and the final report of a drilled well located in southwestern of Iran. In the MLU, the information of different sensors is firstly collected through the data communications protocols and sent to a master unit to be processed into relevant dimensions (i.e. create operational variables). In order to accurately record information, the sensors are calibrated at regular intervals. After removing the outliers, the overall noise of data was reduced by Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing filter. Then, in order to simulate a drilling process in a realistic manner and also to evaluate the performance of the models in approximating the penetration rate at greater depth of hole, the available data were divided into 6 sections based on depth. After that, sections 2 to 6 were separately used as a test dataset and all previous sections were considered as a training dataset. Results indicated that PSO-MLPNN achieved the highest performance in comparing with other developed models. The concluding remark is that ML models are more efficient and reliable than traditional models. In addition, combining ML models with meta-heuristic algorithms can achieve better results than conventional algorithms such as BP.

Advances in distributed systems, miniaturization and commoditization of space electronics and innovations in communications permit us to rethink the current paradigm of relying on a few heavy, slow and expensive high-tech rovers for Mars surface exploration. In this work, we address the demanding communication needs for a mission that deploys a swarm of uncontrolled wind-driven exploration rovers onto the martian surface. The concept for these lightweight, autonomous, ellipsoid”Tumbleweed” rovers - named after the desert plant - is not new, and was studied and validated by NASA researchers decades ago. Recently, a new plan to turn the Tumbleweed mission into reality has been proposed to the ESA open space innovation platform (OSIP). The idea is to launch approximately 90 Tumbleweeds in one transfer vehicle and release them on the martian surface to survey the northern hemisphere of Mars over a mission duration of three months. Reliable communication is one of the key challenges for this mission. The rovers' instruments, e.g. cameras, generate large volumes of data, and many rovers need to be served simultaneously. Furthermore, the tumbling motion on the martian surface constitutes unprecedented challenges in terms of antenna pointing for planetary exploration rovers. We present a trade-off analysis between direct to Earth communication and relayed communication using satellites orbiting Mars culminating in a baseline communication architecture for the Tumbleweed mission. For this purpose we model the kinematics of the Tumbleweed rovers and relay satellites w.r.t the Earth. A numerical simulation of all potential communication links over the full mission duration is conducted. The analysis shows that direct communication to Earth is infeasible due to the rolling motion of the rover. Hence, the relayed communication scenario is proposed, as it does not require a directional antenna on the Tumbleweed rovers. Therefore, we propose a constellation of three relay satellites in a circular, Earth-facing orbital plane around Mars, which communicate with the Tumbleweed rovers using the UHF frequency band. Commercial ground stations on Earth in Ka-band are used for the relay-ground link. The proposed communications architecture is estimated to achieve a raw data throughput of ě84Mbit per Tumbleweed rover per Sol. Copyright © 2022 by Mr. Felix Abel.

This paper examines the Multi-hop Routing with Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (MR-LEACH) to improve the inter-connectivity in the QRDPSO. The MR-LEACH identifies partitions in the network into multi-hop network paths. The multi-hop network paths allow all robots to exchange information without unnecessarily restricting the swarm’s range explicitly. As a result, the QRDPSO with MR-LEACH shows seamless inter-connectivity among the robots, lowering power consumption and increasing robots’ lifetime. Interestingly, this paper also shows that the QRDPSO can reach a faster optimal solution when adopting other communication protocols such as the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) communication schema.

However, instruments often cannot be operated simultaneously due to requirements including viewing angle, illumination, power, and data constraints. This has motivated interest in architectures in which a swarm of small spacecraft, each carrying one instrument, studies a small body after being deployed by a carrier spacecraft; such architectures hold promise to yield significant improvements in mission efficiency, increased data quality, and reduced mission duration. A key difficulty is the selection of orbits for the spacecraft, which must satisfy not only instrument requirements but also communication and data storage constraints. To address this, we propose a novel gradient-based optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimizes spacecraft orbits, observations, and communications; the approach captures instrument requirements, communication bandwidth, and memory usage, and it accommodates irregular gravity field models and surface geometries. Numerical simulations of a six-spacecraft swarm studying the 433 Eros asteroid show that the approach results in a 67.9% increase in data returned as compared to a communication-agnostic approach. Collectively, these results enable system designers to quickly assess the end-to-end performance of multispacecraft constellations, and represent a first step toward communication-aware design of multispacecraft missions for small Solar System body exploration. © 2022 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; CODEN: JGCOD</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141157809&amp;doi=10.2514%2f1.G006515&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5dbd7eeff177c688d958f47d781f0498</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheriguene, Y.</author><author>Bousbaa, F.

This is mainly because deploying a group of cooperating UAVs instead of one single UAV offers numerous advantages, including the extension of the mission coverage, fault tolerance in case of losing a UAV during a mission, and improving the data gathering accuracy. Multicast routing, on the other hand, is a critical operation for UAV swarm networks, as it facilitates critical tasks including information transmission and swarm coordination. Moreover, designing efficient multicast protocols with Quality of Service (QoS) can be challenging due to various factors such as limited energy constraints and the dynamically changing topology with 3D movement which causes frequent changes in the network topology. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the multicast routing problem in a swarm of UAVs. We first provide a detailed classification of existing efforts in swarm routing protocols in terms of transmission strategies. And second, we propose a new Energy Efficient Inter-UAV Multicast Routing Protocol for surveillance and monitoring applications called “COCOMA”. We illustrate through extensive simulations that COCOMA achieves the desired efficient communication backbone and Quality-of-Service. We also discuss and implement an improvement of COCOMA called COCOMA+ and show that both versions are efficient and effective in term of reducing the total emission energy by at least 10 dBm compared to the state-of-art work SP-GMRF. In addition, our proposal optimizes also the End-to-End Delay, the number of hops in the routing process, and the network throughput which consequently leads to increasing the packet delivery ratio by more than to 22% compared to SP-GMRF protocol. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.A.

This lack of coverage is particularly concentrated in rural and low-income areas, in which the lack of a cost-effective electricity supply is the main barrier to expanding network coverage. To tackle this problem, this work proposes a theoretical model based on a self-sustainable 5G network architecture in which the mission planning of a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is efficiently scheduled to provide cellular coverage over the territory and to reduce the required energy consumption. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming is provided to formalize the problem of minimizing the energy consumption required by the swarm of UAVs that are able to provide coverage by operating at different altitudes. In order to practically solve the problem, a Genetic Algorithm is defined and evaluated over a realistic scenario. Results indicate that a higher granularity in the number of altitudes at which UAVs can provide coverage increases the percentage of territory that is covered, while a small penalty on the energy consumption must be paid compared to the case in which an unique altitude over the ground is considered. © 2021</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: J.

Since the GCS belongs to the central control architecture, the edge computing system of the distributed architecture can give drones more flexibility in dealing with changing environmental conditions, allowing them to autonomously and instantly plan their flight path, fly in formation, or even avoid obstacles. Broadcast communications are used to realize UAV-to-UAV communications, thus allocating tasks among a swarm of UAVs and ensuring that each individual UAV collaborates as an integrated member of the group. The dynamic path programming problem for UAV swarm missions uses a two-phase tabu search with a 2-Opt exchange method and an A* search as the path programming algorithm. Distance is taken as a cost function for path programming. The turning points of no-fly zones are then increased and expanded based on drone fleet coverage, thus preventing drones from entering prohibited areas. Unlike previous work, which mostly considers only single no-fly zones, this approach accounts for multiple restricted areas, ensuring that a UAV swarm can complete its assigned task without violating no-fly zones. A drone encountering an obstacle while traveling along the route set by the algorithm will update the map information in real time, allowing for instant recharting of the optimal path to the goal as a reverse search using the D* Lite algorithm. © 2022 by the authors.

VaMEx, abbreviation for Valles Marineris Explorer, is an example of such an initiative. VaMEx aims to survey the canyons of the Valles Marineris, for the duration of one year. A cluster of robotic elements is tasked with the planetary exploration activities. Due to the hazardous environment, it is required that these elements navigate autonomously, broadcast position information and exchange science data during the operational phase of the mission. To support these functions, a VaMEx space segment composed of one (or more) orbiter satellite(s) is proposed. Three possible swarm localization schemes were investigated: 1) radio positioning, 2) cartographic triangulation of ground features from optical images and 3) cartographic triangulation of radar persistent scatters. For each of the proposed navigation concepts, a suitable orbit constellation solution was assessed. Each solution was evaluated in terms of orbit stability, control effort and communications performance using metrics specific to each of the three concepts (length of pass, visibility gaps, geometry constraints, etc.). With the described navigation concept and mission analysis results, a preliminary operational architecture for the VaMEx space segment is conceived, taking into account existing technologies, communications performance, overall mission complexity and feasibility. © 2019 IAA</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: L.

Lacking the effective control and communication algorithms is impeding the development of multi-UAV systems significantly. In this paper, distributed optimal flocking control and network co-design problem has been investigated for networked multi-UAV system in presence of uncertain harsh environment and unknown dynamics. First, the mathematical interaction between network imperfections and practical wireless network channel performance has been investigate. Then, a novel co-model has been developed for networked multi-UAV combining effects from physical system and network channel model effectively. Then, adopting neuro dynamics programming (NDP) technique and actor-critic-identifier (ACI) design architecture, a novel online finite horizon optimal flocking control and network co-design has been proposed. The developed algorithm cannot merely obtain the distributed optimal co-design within finite time, but also relax the stringent requirement about physical UAV system and network dynamics. In addition, developed novel co-design can satisfy the practical constraints, e.g. transmit power constraint etc. The Lyapunov stability analysis is used to validate the effectiveness of developed scheme. With the proper NN weight update law, proposed co-design can ensure all closed-loop signals and NN weights are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Furthermore, simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme. © 2017 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Conference name: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017; Conference date: 11 April 2017 through 13 April 2017; Conference code: 128631; CODEN: PSISD&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XIX&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017 - April 13, 2017&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017 - April 13, 2017</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025141412&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.2262877&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c096d1ae2d38ce7fd8509ec464ed1327</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2262877</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Anaheim, CA, United states</custom1><custom3>Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017 - April 13, 2017</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hernández-Herrera, A.</author><author>Espino, E.

However, being a technology in development, the security and vulnerability of the swarm of robots against possible cybernetic attacks have been commonly overlooked. This is of major concern when executing mission-critical activities that inherently require an adequate management of security. In this work, a bio-inspired security mechanism applied to a swarm of robots is proposed. Through computer simulations, it is observed how the mechanism, when executing a homing towards a stationary landmark, allows the swarm of robots to identify abnormal behaviors, caused by a certain cyberattack; subsequently, it establishes a certain tolerance to it and allows to improve the level of availability that is required to continue executing the task at hand. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.

The mathematic model of coalition formation is built on basis of the minimum attacking time and the minimum coalition size with satisfying resources and simultaneous strikes requirements. A communication protocol based on maximum number of hops is developed to determine the potential coalition members in dynamic network. A multistage sub-optimal coalition formation algorithm (MSOCFA) with polynomial time is established. The performances of MSOCFA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are compared in terms of complexity, mission performance and computational time. A complex scenario is deployed to illustrate how the coalitions are formed and validate the feasibility of the MSOCFA. The effect of communication constraints (hop delay and max-hops) on mission performance is studied. The results show that it is beneficial to determine potential coalition members in a wide and deep range over the network in the presence of less delay. However, when the delays are significant, it is more advantageous to determine coalitions from among the immediate neighbors. © 2017, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

With this rapid growth, studies using UAVs are underway in various areas. UAVs are more economical and effective when utilizing several nodes rather than operating a single aircraft. In general, UAVs collect and transmit information to the control center (CC), and act on control commands from the CC. Communication between UAVs and the control center is usually achieved using modules such as radio frequency (RF), Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and cellular. However, when multiple UAVs communicate directly with the CC, the limitations of communication technologies and problems with increasing nodes occur. To address these points, several studies have constructed an ad-hoc network of UAVs to address the limitations of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication range, or the high cost of cellular systems. However, previous studies have constructed fixed topology ad-hoc networks. These studies did not take into account the problem of changing network topology due to the rapid mobility and frequent formation changes of UAVs. Due to this, limits occurred such that UAVs moved only in the pre-built topology. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topology construction protocol for UAV swarms to address this problem. The main contents of this paper are as follows. We first look at the research and limitations of existing UAV communications, and propose a protocol to solve this problem. This paper proposes a protocol for UAV construction of ad-hoc networks when trying to perform missions using multiple UAVs, and also describes how the changed network topology is reconstructed when network topology changes due to changes in flight formation. Finally, we establish a situation and apply the proposed protocol, analyze the results and describe further required research. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: S.

Evolutionary algorithms are a conventional method to solve complex optimization problems with multiple constraints. However, they are time-consuming algorithms which make their implementation difficult. UAV path planning is usually a real-time problem that is needed to solve in limited time steps. Parallelization is one of the most effective methods for reducing the computation time of evolutionary algorithms. In the industrial applications, usually there is a communication platform between devices which can be used for the implementation of the parallelization process. For example, controller area network (CAN) is a protocol used for reliable communication in aerospace systems. Due to the development of this protocol on UAVs and its characteristics, it can be used for parallel optimization of path planning problem. In this paper, an asynchronous distributed multi-master parallel genetic algorithm and a parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm are implemented on CAN bus to improve the speed and performance of the UAV path planning. © 2019, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: V.

Such a task requires angular resolutions of less than 0.2 arc-seconds in extreme ultraviolet, which cannot be economically done with a conventional space telescope. Performing such a mission requires unprecedented relative navigation tolerances, a need for active collision avoidance, a development of inter-satellite communication, and a propulsion system that enables the relative navigation maneuvers. The mission was initially conceived as a three 3U satellite formation in the NSF CubeSat Innovations Ideas Lab to address NSF science goals with innovative technologies. Once beginning conceptual subsystem design, it was evident that significant constraints linked to the three 3U satellite formation configuration limit the likelihood of mission success and increase mission risk. A trade study was conducted to determine potential resolutions to the problems associated with the initial three 3U satellite formation configuration. The completion of the trade study resulted in a major design change to a two 6U satellite configuration that resolved the issues associated with the initial configuration, improved mission success while reducing risk, and intends to incorporate novel CubeSat technologies, all of which enable the mission to move forward. This paper discusses the path that led the team to conduct the trade study, the design alternatives considered, and the innovative subsystem technologies that were conceived as a result of updating the satellite formation configuration. © 2020 The MITRE Corporation.

In order to create a vantage point, young professionals and students from the four corners of the earth had performed a comprehensive study at the 2014 Space Generation Congress in Toronto, Canada under "CubeSat Swarms Communication Networks and Policy Challenges" working group. While potential possibilities are endless for the structure of Cubesat networks, decisions made amongst the group were based on existing technologies and guidelines. Therefore, the working group discussed (1) short and long term technical challenges (2) policy requirements, (3) radio communication bandwidth limitations, (4) data collection and transmission regulations and (5) the standardization of the CubeSat communication system. Technical challenges for small satellite missions involve limitations of link budgets, the size of the déployable high gain antennas, optical and laser communication and the restriction of the link budget due to the interferences. In addition, policy issues have immaturities for frequency allocation and registration complimenting the short lifespan of CubeSats. The standardization of mission operations enables a space communication network architecture that of which is similar to the internet, incorporated into CubeSat Swarms. The group suggests a CubeSat network system architecture including inter-swarm and intra-swarm constellations, optical and laser communications and delay-tolerant networks (DTN). The proposed CubeSat communication network also consists of inter-swarm constellation communications along with intra-swarm constellations sustained through four different basic data links, a mother-daughter satellite framework, and net-neutrality throughout the network. In the meantime, policy regulation recommendations allow global communication by reducing data downlink time. Governments, as well as service providers, treat all data used online the same regardless of its origins, platform, and users. The standardization of the CubeSat network system was formed by operator expectations for high downlink speeds, equal priority for data transfers, and streamlined registrations. The simplified registration process for CubeSat-Swarms is more efficient by establishing new baseline legal framework, rules, and standards. This would help all users and operators in this sector, including entrepreneurs, licensing bodies, and end-users.

Furthermore, a system based on a swarm of UAVs is attracting much attention for its efficiency of a mission execution performance compare to a single UAV system. However, to support those scenarios, communication path should be maintained among UAVs and ground control station, therefore guaranteeing a reliable ad hoc network is an important issue. Regarding this, in this paper, we provide development of flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) routing protocol and UAV-based testbeds environments which can be used for the experimentation for the developed routing protocol in which they consist of ground control station (GCS), multi-UAV system, network topology monitor, and 802.11p FANET communication modem. © 2019 The Vertical Flight Society.

More than 40 missions have targeted Mars, and over 100 have been sent to the moon. Space agencies continue to focus on developing novel strategies and technologies for probing celestial bodies. Multirobot systems are particularly promising for planetary exploration, as they are more robust to individual failure and have the potential to examine larger areas; however, there are limits to how many robots an operator can control individually. We recently took part in the European Space Agency's (ESA's) interdisciplinary equipment test campaign (PANGAEA-X) at a lunar/Mars analog site in Lanzarote, Spain. We used a heterogeneous fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-a swarm-to study the interplay of systems operations and human factors. Human operators directed the swarm via ad hoc networks and data-sharing protocols to explore unknown areas under two control modes: in one, the operator instructed each robot separately; in the other, the operator provided general guidance to the swarm, which self-organized via a combination of distributed decision making and consensus building. We assessed cognitive load via pupillometry for each condition and perceived task demand and intuitiveness via selfreport. Our results show that implementing higher autonomy with swarm intelligence can reduce workload, freeing the operator for other tasks such as overseeing strategy and communication. Future work will further leverage advances in swarm intelligence for exploration missions. © 1994-2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 24; CODEN: IRAME</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081352237&amp;doi=10.1109%2fMRA.2019.2940413&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6d3014b56edc6ccc4f2db002505f318a</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Priyadharshini, C.</author><author>Selvan, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PSO based dynamic route recovery protocol for predicting route lifetime and maximizing network lifetime in MANET</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Technological Innovations in ICT for Agriculture and Rural Development, TIAR 2016</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proc. - IEEE Int.

This may lead a node to drain their energy and also affect the performance of routing protocol and network lifetime. Several researches have gone so far for predicting node lifetime and link lifetime. To address this problem a new algorithm has been developed which utilizes the network parameters relating to dynamic nature of nodes viz. energy drain rate, relative mobility estimation to predict the route lifetime. But this has given a problem of network congestion and delay. To mitigate this problem, in this paper we have implemented an algorithm which uses the prediction parameters that are fuzzified and fuzzy rules have been formed to decide on the node status. This status information is made to exchange among all the nodes. Before every transmission the status of each and every node is verified. Even for a weak node, the performance of a route recovery mechanism is made in such a way that corresponding routes are diverted to the strong nodes. Thereby it reduces the data loss and communication overhead using PSO prediction algorithm and here NS2 simulator is used for simulation. © 2016 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 8; Conference name: 2nd IEEE International Conference on Technological Innovations in ICT for Agriculture and Rural Development, TIAR 2016; Conference date: 15 July 2016 through 16 July 2016; Conference code: 125652&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Many corporate proposals already explore satellite constellations as the backbone of a global, space-based Internet service [1], [2]. However, these constellation proposals are usually owned by a single entity or conglomerate, and operated to serve a particular business model. Building on the theme of crowd-sharing models and innovative research in distributed system-control algorithms, we propose a constellation-management system and multi-functional CubeSat hardware platform that would allow communal use of satellite functionality, including opportunities for non-conflicting concurrent processes and re-purposing of satellite hardware. By coupling communication and data ledger protocols (e.g. modified blockchains) with machine learning algorithms for smart task distribution and execution management, this research describes a way to orchestrate peer-to-peer network collaborations where satellite constellation functionality is dynamically rented, shared or reused between many applications. We envision multi-purpose, shared- use satellite constellations, bringing this category of space hardware into the “on-demand” services market (along the lines of Amazon Web Services, but for broad space applications) and moving beyond more narrow applications of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) currently deployed in orbit [3]. This model for allocation of a shared research resource, where a ledger is kept to distribute access fairly, builds on years of scientific collaboration processes [4] created around expensive, limited-use hardware resources (e.g., multinational collaborations that split time on large telescopes or the CERN particle accelerator [5]). This research proposes to automate and enhance this process, exploring remote-activation and operations of space-based resources. This paper will discuss the BlockSat mission architecture and ConOps (Concept of Operations), showing how the integration of a multi-functional hardware platform and cloud-computing participation model can create a new class of small satellite operations. We aim to free satellite deployments from the limitations of single-use applications and propose a new “open space” market that can democratize access to LEO space technology.

In addition, the increasing capabilities of the computer vision in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and obstacles localization allow to integrate an efficient and robust multi-vision based navigation system thus supplying learning capacity. This architecture is typical of an autonomous rover, i.e. a mobile platform which is able to navigate, to plan and follow a safe path without human remote control. These skills are obviously mandatory requirements for space missions like planetary or asteroid exploration. Till now, typical missions has been characterized by non-cooperative autonomous rovers working in different and quite far areas. Increased availability of performing autonomous platforms now suggests to plan missions involving a swarm of cooperative rovers exploring a predefined area of a planet, an asteroid or a comet, with a common target. Coordination leads to versatility and lower cost in terms of data return. The logic of cooperation is based on the fact that each member of the swarm shares a set of information that might help the others in achieving their tasks. The paper describes a possible system architecture of a swarm of two small rovers designed, built and tested at the Guidance and Navigation Lab of Università di Roma "La Sapienza". The goal of the mission is to reach a common and pre-assigned target position - a hypothetic scientific post on the surface of a planet - while exploring and analysing the surrounding environment. The coordinates of a localised obstacles are shared with the other member in order to build a common and continuously upgradable map of the environment and a database of available safe paths. The whole architecture of the designed autonomous guidance and vision-based navigation system together with the communication system are presented in detail.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: M.

But in the previous work, it is assumed that each LEO satellites could directly connect with the GEO controllers. This is unreasonable when the LEO data plane is a large-scale LEO satellite constellation, as the number of GEO controllers and antennas of each GEO controller are limited. In this work, we propose a design of software defined large-scale LEO satellite networks with limited GEO controllers, where the communication between GEO control plane and LEO data plane is achieved by limited cross-layer links. In this model, the selection of cross-layer links directly affects the load balance among GEO controllers and the latencies of control paths, which will deeply influence the latency of routing response. Thus, we propose a switching-aware dynamic control path planning scheme to handle this, where we propose a switching-time selection scheme to handle the impact of switching and a multi-objective optimization problem to deal with the selection of cross-layer links, and finally present a particle swarm optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the better performance on reducing the bad influence of switching, optimizing the load balance among controllers and the average latencies of control paths. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: T.

Swarm-based architectures -which comprise multiple agents operating collectively as a distributed system- have been proposed for Earth observation, astronomy, planetary exploration, and heliophysics. Some of the key technology demonstration missions have already successfully flown in the past decades. The increasing interest in satellite swarms suggests that this innovative architecture will be adopted in a variety of future missions in the coming years, raising the question of how to dispose of satellite swarms at the end of their operational lifetimes. Mega-constellations or swarms comprising of numerous small satellites are difficult to track by Earth-based networks. They also increase the risk of collisions, particularly during end-of-life when these small satellites cannot be maneuvered to avoid collisions with functional satellite systems. Previously, distributed small satellite missions such as KickSat-2 and SpaceBEES 1-4 were designed to passively deorbit and burn up during atmospheric re-entry at the end of their lifetimes. However, disposing of satellite swarms outside low LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) has no trivial solution which both meets space situational awareness requirements and aligns with the philosophy of space sustainability. The distributed functionality which makes swarm missions so flexible and adaptable also means that many individual swarm agents have to be disposed of at end-of-life, rendering traditional approaches such as migration to the GEO (Geosynchronous Earth Orbit) graveyard orbit problematic. The challenges of disposing satellite swarms are as varied as the environments they could operate in - swarms used for planetary exploration will have to respect planetary protection policies while swarms engaged in Earth observation missions will have to be safely deorbited amidst an increasingly crowded LEO environment. In this paper we explore how the autonomy and distributed nature of swarms both complicates end-of-life disposal and simultaneously enables novel solutions to post-mission disposal. We then survey existing end-of-life scenarios for satellite swarms and propose a novel research approach to swarm disposal that could comply with both legal requirements and the philosophy of space sustainability.

The S-Band Network for co-operating Satellites (S-Net) is a cluster of four nanosats developed by the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (TUB) and successfully launched in 2018 from Vostochny cosmodrome. S-Net is designed to verify an S-band transceiver developed by the company IQ wireless and TUB and furthermore test the communications architecture for distributed nanosats developed by the TUB. Networked swarms of small satellites provide new opportunities for a large range of missions including data collection with distributed sensors, disaster monitoring or machine-to-machine communication. This paper describes the in-orbit results of the communication network architecture of the mission S Net. Three different approaches for the organization of a reliable inter-satellite networking are discussed. The first one is based on token passing through the small cluster and comes without a central spacecraft collecting the data from other nodes and distributing them. The second one is the approach with a central node and the third in a de-centralized architecture with a random access. All three architectures are based on the same physical layer with 0.5 W RF power, adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) and the same data layer protocol stack, both implemented as a digital radio in a compact single unit with a weight of approximately 0.5 kg. Furthermore, the problems of routing and antenna pointing for the mission are addressed. Finally, future work based on S-Net is discussed. Â© 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation.

As a critical component of an aviation swarm, airborne tactical network (ATN) provides the communication capability. Considering the deficiencies of today's ATNs, it is unable to meet the communication demands of an aviation swarm, which motivates us to employ the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm and design a SDN-enabled airborne tactical network (SD-ATN). For the SDN paradigm, network monitoring information (M-info) is the source of knowledge that forms the globe network view of the control plane; therefore, how to ensure that the control plane collects M-info from the data plane in a reliable and real-time way is a fundamental problem of designing the SD-ATN. To address this issue, a transmission framework called the MCF-SD-ATN is first designed, which makes it practical to provide dedicated quality of service (QoS) guarantees for the M-info collection. Then, a communication protocol called the MCP-SD-ATN is designed to implement the M-info collection work based on the MCF-SD-ATN. We implement the MCF-SD-ATN and the MCP-SD-ATN in EXata 5.1 for simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is appropriate for M-info collection in the SD-ATN. © 2018 Kefan Chen et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: K.

This PPSO consists of three parallel PSOs along with a communication operator in one FPGA chip. The parallel computing architecture takes advantages of maintaining better population diversity and inhibiting premature convergence in comparison with conventional PSOs. The collision-free discontinuous path generated from the PPSO planner is then smoothed using the cubic B-spline and system-on-a-programmable-chip (SoPC) technology.

These bodies may also one day serve as resource restocking de-pots for longer duration missions. However, in-situ scientific analysis requires the development of microgravity-tolerant landers that are not subject to recoil on impact. Whereas prior art focuses primarily on anchoring and hopping mechanisms, this paper evaluates a novel mission architecture in which chains of bistable pinching elements called grapplers are used to land net-like infrastructure on low gravity bodies. Unlike single-point-of-contact landers, a net that is successfully adhered to an asteroid may serve broad and flexible use in the exploration of small bodies. For example, it may constitute infrastructure to enable locomotion of a swarm of distributed crawling sensors and actuators for high resolution study of the body’s interior structure and surface properties. It may also serve as a foundation onto which larger scale sensing and communication structures can be built over time. Finally, it may serve as a series of hand holds used by astronauts to maneuver around the body. To adhere the net to a body, microgravity flight testing of a representative Grappler prototype demonstrates the tolerance of a bistable chain to variable impact conditions and terrain contours owing to the inherent adaptivity of the chain’s pinching configuration-for a chain of n bistable elements, 2n pinching configurations are possible. These pinching elements can be integrated sparsely or densely into net-like infrastructure. A computational model is also presented. Grapplers are compared to alternative net adhesion strategies ranging from passive wrapping to chemical rigidization. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The integrated simulator exploits some already existing tools to simulate a specific part of the overall Unmanned aerial vehicle hardware and software structure: a 3D visualization engine, a physics simulator, a flight control stack and a network simulator to handle communications among Unmanned aerial vehicles. These features are provided by the tools Gazebo, ArduCopterand ns-3 that, however, are not designed to work together in an integrated manner. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a software middleware that coordinates all of these tools, which may optionally be run on multiple interconnected computers, and lets them have a common notion of simulated time during the simulation; moreover, the middleware coordinates the activities of the High-level Logic, which is the software part that implements the strategy and control of the multi Unmanned aerial vehicle application. A Python API is provided to allow developers to write their Unmanned aerial vehicle application (cooperative missions, flocking, etc.) in such a way as to be first simulated and then run onto the real platform with no or few modifications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: F.F.

In parallel, several applications are being envisioned that bring together a swarm of multiple networked micro air vehicles to accomplish large tasks in coordination. However, it is still very challenging to deploy multiple micro air vehicles concurrently. To address this challenge, we have developed an open software/hardware platform called the University at Buffalo’s Airborne Networking and Communications Testbed (UB-ANC), and an associated emulation framework called the UB-ANC Emulator. In this paper, we present the UB-ANC Emulator, which combines multi-micro air vehicle planning and control with high-fidelity network simulation, enables practitioners to design micro air vehicle swarm applications in software and provides seamless transition to deployment on actual hardware. We demonstrate the UB-ANC Emulator’s accuracy against experimental data collected in two mission scenarios: a simple mission with three networked micro air vehicles and a sophisticated coverage path planning mission with a single micro air vehicle. To accurately reflect the performance of a micro air vehicle swarm where communication links are subject to interference and packet losses, and protocols at the data link, network, and transport layers affect network throughput, latency, and reliability, we integrate the open-source discrete-event network simulator ns-3 into the UB-ANC Emulator. We demonstrate through node-to-node and end-to-end measurements how the UB-ANC Emulator can be used to simulate multiple networked micro air vehicles with accurate modeling of mobility, control, wireless channel characteristics, and network protocols defined in ns-3. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: N.

The current POD approach must be performed only on ground in post-processing. The orbit accuracy achieved with the POD is typically between 0.1 mm/s to 1 mm/s for the velocity. Despite being in line with mission needs, the post-processing limitation is preventing its use for more advanced applications that require high accuracy in real-time, such as formation flying, autonomous docking and rendezvous, increased spacecraft autonomy, etc. This contribution investigates how to overcome the real-time limitations and shows that real-time Precise Onboard Orbit Determination (P2OD) could be achieved in the near future, bringing the current ground PPP (Precise Point Positioning) and PPP-RTK (Precise Point Positioning -Real Time Kinematic) concept to space users. The target real-time orbit accuracy to be achieved with this approach is 10 cm RMS 3D (1 mm/s for velocity). Different algorithms have already been developed for onboard orbit determination, ranging from a least square approach to Extended or Unscented Kalman Filtering (EKF, UKF). Usually the initial position is provided through a Single Point Positioning (SPP) technique, using only the pseudorange measurements. The SPP solution can be smoothed by fitting a dynamic model. These onboard algorithms allow to reach an orbital velocity accuracy (3D RMS) at m/s or cm/s level ([23], [24], [25], [26] and [27]). Several studies ([28], [29] and [30]) have also investigated the optimization of the force models acting on the satellites and the related parameters for propagating the orbit with the electronics onboard a LEO satellite. The main limitation for such onboard OD algorithms is the lack of precise ephemeris and clock products for the GNSS satellites in real-time. GNSS receivers in space can use techniques and concepts adoptable by GNSS receiver on ground. There are at least two main concepts for real-time high accuracy positioning computation based on GNSS: RTK and PPP. RTK relies on use of ground stations in the proximity of the user receiver, therefore cannot be considered viable from space users. PPP (and its evolution, the PPP-RTK) is based on the broadcast of precise corrections (mainly precise orbits and clocks, but also a precise ionospheric model and, for PPP-RTK, delta phase correction for performing Integer Ambiguity Resolution on the rover) through different communication channels (e.g., via geostationary satellites, GSM, Internet). This study addresses two main types of communication channels for providing precise orbit and clock corrections of the GNSS satellites: the dedicated broadcast and the global broadcast channels. The dedicated broadcast channel assumes that each GNSS satellite (e.g.: GPS or Galileo) broadcasts its own precise corrections for orbits and clocks. Such a condition could be achieved with an improvement of the current broadcasted ephemerides and clocks (via standard navigation message) or via a dedicated communication channel provided by the GNSS satellites that goes on top of the broadcasted navigation message. In this scenario the available bandwidth is normally limited, so the amount of corrections that can be disseminated is limited (allowing to transmit only the corrections for the satellite itself or a small group of nearby satellites) and there is a need for a constant communication contact from the uplink stations to all or a high number of the GNSS satellites. Modern GNSS systems are very close to provide the infrastructure to enable the dedicated broadcast scheme and the present study aims to propose potential strategies to overcome the current limitations. The global broadcast channel relies on geostationary satellites for disseminating the precise corrections for all the GNSS satellites at the same time. Two major cases are considered: SBAS and commercial PPP providers. SBAS is planned to achieve worldwide coverage by 2020, but the dissemination of precise corrections to achieve cm level accuracy is today outside the scope of such systems, mainly because providing the integrity for such an accuracy might be not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, a new service providing high accuracy corrections (initially without integrity) could be implemented using a potentially available spare bandwidth in the SBAS. Nowadays, commercial geostationary satellites are the only way to achieve the dissemination of precise corrections, using commercial PPP service providers that currently cover the entire globe. This work will analyze the implications of using such communication channels on the space receiver architecture. The adopted solution will be suitable for different types of 24h 3-axis stabilized LEO spacecraft, from nano-satellites to large Earth-observing satellites. A novel concept based on the use of multi-antennas will be proposed to overcome the weak communication links above the poles for receiving the corrections from geostationary satellites. The real-time precise orbit determination will be sequentially computed with an EKF-based OD algorithm. The approach will be validated using real data from flying missions. Finally, a potential roadmap for In-Orbit Demonstration (IOD) will be presented. © 2017 Institute of Navigation.

As a new form of flying things, they can access the network for better communication via the aerial base station. Most of the Unmanned aerial vehicles assisted flying objects' optimal path selection schemes does not consider the path deviation. In path deviation attacks, secure data transmission are not addressed in existing works. The secure communication process between Unmanned aerial vehicles and base station are exploited through security-based attacks. Moreover, path loss issue leads to multicast packet loss and unsecured broadcast. The existing network architecture setup does not fulfill the secure data communication and privacy issues. In this paper, Blockchain is utilized to investigate the secure communication between Unmanned aerial vehicles to Wireless Unmanned aerial vehicles Base stations. Since the destination information is dynamic under an uncertain environment, it will cause a delay in data communication. Unmanned aerial vehicles are more vulnerable to security attacks. The proposed blockchain-based architecture supports secure data communication in Unmanned aerial vehicles uncertain environments. To improve network security, this paper designs a modified particle swarm optimization method for better path selection. Through these experimental results, a blockchain-based data communication scheme is outer performed concerning network security. © 2021.

In particular, since it preys on honey bees, its recent progression in Europe could soon pose a significant risk to the local apiculture activity. European beekeepers are therefore investigating adapted control strategies, including V. velutina nest destruction. Unfortunately, nest location pinpointing generally follows a manual process which can prove tedious, time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose the use of a network of micro aerial vehicles featuring autonomous and cooperative flight capabilities. We describe an adapted controlled mobility strategy and detail the design of our Virtual Force Protocol (VFP) which allows a swarm of vehicles to track and follow hornets to their nests, while maintaining connectivity through a wireless multi-hop communication route with a remote ground station used to store applicative data such as hornet trajectory and vehicle telemetry. In order to achieve the mission objectives with a minimum of vehicles, we identify through simulations appropriate value for the key parameters of VFP and discuss the obtained network performance.

OLFAR (Orbiting Low Frequency Array for Radio astronomy) is one such mission where 10 to 50+ nanosatellites are placed in the Lunar orbit and perform astronomical observations from the far-side of the moon. Each of the nanosatellite in the swarm would carry a receiver that performs observations between 0.3 - 30 MHz, which are the least explored frequency bands in radio astronomy, thus attracting a large scientific interest. Observations in this frequency bands from Earth are highly challenging as the ionosphere is opaque to these frequency bands. Furthermore, RFI (Radio Frequency Interferences) generated on Earth makes it highly challenging to perform astronomical observations below 30MHz band. The impediments faced by Earth-based or near-Earth-based radio astronomy for these frequency bands is the motivation to perform measurements from the far-side of the moon. The purpose of using a swarm of nanosatellites to perform low frequency observations is to enable the realization of long observation baselines and additionally, the effective aperture of observation increases with the number of satellites. For the swarm of nanosatellites to operate as a single aperture, it is very important to cross-correlate the information collected by each satellite and this is where the ISL becomes very crucial. Apart from exchanging data collected by the payload, other information such as attitude and timing information needs to be exchanged. This work derived mission level requirements which would be used to define a suitable communication architecture for space-based radio astronomy missions such as OLFAR. The approach chosen for communication system for such a swarm mission will comprise of two types of ISL: High data-rate directional link that will be used to exchange payload date and low data-rate omni-directional link that will be used to exchange attitude, timing information and be used for localization, positioning and ranging of the nanosatellites in the swarm. This work will present link budgets to show the feasibility of the proposed communication architecture and derive the specs to further design the transceivers.

Autonomy is a critical need for these systems, since the cost associated with applying conventional approaches for command and control does not scale with the number of spacecraft. Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy (DSA) is a project developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that enables distributed spacecraft systems through the development of three capabilities: scalable communication, distributed coordination and planning, and human-swarm interaction. DSA will demonstrate these capabilities in two contexts. The first context is a flight demonstration consisting of a software payload hosted on the Starling-1 small-spacecraft mission. This software payload will use the on-board GPS receiver to perform in-situ, swarm-level reconfiguration in response to observed features in the Topside Ionosphere. The second context is a scalability study, which shows how the technologies developed in the flight demonstration can scale to a large number of spacecraft (≈ 100).

Mixed-reality simulations where both virtual and physical entities can coexist and interact have been shown to be beneficial for development, testing, and verification of such systems. This paper deals with the problems of designing a certain communication subsystem for such highly desirable realistic simulations. Requirements of this communication subsystem, including proper addressing, transparent routing, visibility modeling, or message management, are specified prior to designing an appropriate solution. Then, a suitable architecture of this communication subsystem is proposed together with solutions to the challenges that arise when simultaneous virtual and physical message transmissions occur. The proposed architecture can be utilized as a high-fidelity network simulator for vehicular systems with implicit mobility models that are given by real trajectories of the vehicles. The architecture has been utilized within multiple projects dealing with the development and practical deployment of multi-UAV systems, which support the architecture’s viability and advantages. The provided experimental results show the achieved similarity of the communication characteristics of the fully deployed hardware setup to the setup utilizing the proposed mixed-reality architecture. © 2018 by the authors.

This research paper aims to perform multidisciplinary design and optimization for an expendable microsatellite launch vehicle (MSLV) comprising three solid-propellant stages, capable of delivering micro-payloads in the low earth orbit. The methodology’s primary purpose is to increase the conceptual and preliminary design process’s efficiency by reducing both the design and development costs. Design/methodology/approach: Multidiscipline feasible architecture is applied for the multidisciplinary design and optimization of an expendable MSLV at the conceptual level to accommodate interdisciplinary interactions during the optimization process. The multidisciplinary design and optimization framework developed and implemented in this research effort encompasses coupled analysis disciplines of vehicle geometry, mass calculations, aerodynamics, propulsion and trajectory. Nineteen design variables were selected to optimize expendable MSLV to launch a 100 kg satellite at an altitude of 600 km in the low earth orbit. Modern heuristic optimization methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SA are applied and compared to obtain the optimal configurations. The initial population is created by passing the upper and lower bounds of design variables to the optimizer. The optimizer then searches for the best possible combination of design variables to obtain the objective function while satisfying the constraints. Findings: All of the applied heuristic methods were able to optimize the design problem. Optimized design variables from these methods lie within the lower and upper bounds. This research successfully achieves the desired altitude and final injection velocity while satisfying all the constraints. In this research effort, multiple runs of heuristic algorithms reduce the fundamental stochastic error. Research limitations/implications: The use of multiple heuristics optimization methods such as GA, PSO and SA in the conceptual design phase owing to the exclusivity of their search approach provides a unique opportunity for exploration of the feasible design space and helps in obtaining alternative configurations capable of meeting the mission objectives, which is not possible when using any of the single optimization algorithm. Practical implications: The optimized configurations can be further used as baseline configurations in the microsatellite launch missions’ conceptual and preliminary design phases. Originality/value: Satellite launch vehicle design and optimization is a complex multidisciplinary problem, and it is dealt with effectively in the multidisciplinary design and optimization domain. It integrates several interlinked disciplines and gives the optimum result that satisfies these disciplines’ requirements. This research effort provides the multidisciplinary design and optimization-based simulation framework to predict and evaluate various expendable satellite launch vehicle configurations’ performance. This framework significantly increases the conceptual and preliminary design process’s efficiency by reducing design and development costs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: A.F.

In the event of fire, mine collapse or disasters like earthquake, swarm of robots can enter the area, conduct rescue operations, collect images and convey locations of interest to the rescue team and enable them to plan their approach in advance. Task allocation among members of the swarm is a critical and challenging problem to be addressed. DTTA- a distributed, Time-division multiple access (TDMA) based task allocation framework is proposed for swarm of robots which can be utilised to solve any of the 8 different types of task allocation problem identified by Gerkey and Mataric'. DTTA is reactive and supports task migration via extended task assignments to complete the mission in case of failure of the assigned robot to complete the task. DTTA can be utilised for any kind of robot in land or for co-operative systems comprising of land robots and air-borne drones. Dependencies with other layers of the protocol stack were identified and a quantitative analysis of communication and computational complexity is provided. To our knowledge this is the first work to be reported on task allocation for clustered scalable networks suitable for handling all 8 types of multi-robot task allocation problem. Effectiveness and feasibility of deploying DTTA in real world scenarios is demonstrated by testing the framework for two diverse application scenarios. © 2017, DESIDOC.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 6; CODEN: DSJOA</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018346851&amp;doi=10.14429%2fdsj.67.10995&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=643b03ed565ee009ad3fa12db6c4df11</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.14429/dsj.67.10995</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wolf, M.

The new developments extend the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's CARACaS (Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing) autonomy architecture, which provides foundational software infrastructure, core executive functions, and several default robotic technology modules. In Swarm II, CARACaS demonstrated higher levels of autonomy and more complex cooperation than previous on-water exercises, using full-sized vehicles and real-world sensing and communication. The core autonomous behaviors to support the harbor patrol scenario included Patrol, Track, Inspect, and Trail, providing the capability of finding all vessels entering the patrol area, keeping track of them, inspecting them to infer intent, and trailing suspect vessels. Significantly, CARACaS assumed responsibility for not only executing tasks safely and efficiently but also recognizing what tasks needed to be accomplished, given the current state of the world. Since the heterogeneous USV teams shared world model that evolved, such as due to (dis) appearance of vessels in the area or a change in health or availability of a USV, CARACaS replanned to generate and reallocate the new task list. Thus, human intervention was never required in the loop to task USVs during mission execution, though a supervisory role was supported in the autonomy system for mission monitoring and exception handling. Finally, CARACaS also ensured the USVs avoided hazards and obeyed the applicable rules of the road, using its local motion planning modules. © 2017 SPIE.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 10; Conference name: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017; Conference date: 11 April 2017 through 13 April 2017; Conference code: 128631; CODEN: PSISD&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: UNMANNED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY XIX&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017 - April 13, 2017&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017 - April 13, 2017</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025166518&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.2262067&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e6eccd9ece661f2356e6491b6c916f43</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2262067</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>Anaheim, CA, United states</custom1><custom3>Unmanned Systems Technology XIX Conference 2017, April 11, 2017 - April 13, 2017</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carpentiero, M.</author><author>Sabatini, M.</author><author>Palmerini, G.

Continuous evolution in robotics technologies, including improvement in sensors, in miniaturization, in software engineering allows to focus on the concept of unmanned, autonomous exploration carried on by swarm of mobile robots. As taught by several biology's examples, the cooperation among smaller, simpler agents provide effectiveness and ensures a good return even in case of the loss of some - or several - robots. This cooperation is primarily based on the exchange among the swarm's agents of information including payload data and positioning insight. A simple (to keep expandable platforms and their subsystems at a reasonable level in cost and complexity), yet effective communication and navigation architecture is requested to perform the task. The paper is part of a project aiming to first analyse the requirements for this architecture at the general level, and then investigate possible solutions by means of numerical simulations performed with purposely prepared software codes. Performance clearly depends on the mission environment, and in such a concern swarms composed by rovers, drones or low-altitude flying platforms have to be considered, include peculiar motion constraints and issues. Simulations consider radiofrequency links in different bands, with preliminary modelling of the channels' characteristics. Obstacles and outages, breaking the connections, are modelled. A specific attention is devoted to the navigation, in order to assess the nature and amount of data required to provide either a relative or absolute positioning capability: this information is crucial for referencing the data collected by the payload as well as for the coordinated guidance of the swarm. Being robustness the crucial asset of the swarm concept, the performance in different mission scenarios are evaluated on the basis of both deterministic and non-deterministic failures. Previous hands-on experience gained from studies and experiments devoted to small fleets of rovers operating in terrestrial, hostile environment is an important input for this research. As a result, a software code in MATLAB has been prepared and tested in order to be able, during next step of the project, to simulate in details the behaviour of fleets ranging from 2 to tens of agents operating in different scenarios of interest for planetary exploration. In this software code, the communications behaviour enters by limiting the mutual availability of information to the different agents (outages due to interposed obstacles) or out-of-range relative positioning. Navigation instead comes with the uncertainty in the knowledge of the kinematic state. These missing data affect the guidance computation and indeed limit the effectiveness of the exploration itself. © 2018 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

Communication bandwidth is extremely limited in the underwater domain, hence it is crucial to efficiently manage and distribute this scarce resource between nodes. This paper discusses a symmetric, distributed time-slotted channel access algorithm for large-scale, dynamic ad-hoc networks. In contrast to traditional network algorithms which are mostly designed for sporadic point-to-point communication, this algorithm specifically optimises fast, continuous information distribution, locally and globally, while achieving close to 100% channel utilisation. A theoretical analysis of the performance is presented, along with real-time simulation results for dozens of nodes performing rapid reconfigurations. The impact of swarm dynamics on network performance is analysed in detail. © IFAC.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Conference name: 9th IFAC Conference on Manoeuvring and Control of Marine Craft, MCMC 2012; Conference date: 19 September 2012 through 21 September 2012; Conference code: 105079&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: IFAC Proc.

Such networks can be very useful in practice in applications that require fine-grain monitoring of physical environment subjected to critical conditions (such as inaccessible terrains or disaster places). Features including the huge number of sensor devices involved, the severe power, computational and memory limitations, their dense deployment and frequent failures, pose new design and implementation aspects. The efficient and robust realization of such large, highly-dynamic, complex, non-conventional, environments is a challenging algorithmic task. We here present the Forward Planning Situated Protocol (FPSP), for scalable, energy efficient and fault tolerant data propagation in situated wireless sensor networks. To deal with the increased complexity of such deeply networked sensor systems, instead of emphasizing on a particular aspect of the services provided, i.e. either for low-energy periodic, or low-latency event-driven, or high-success query-based sensing, FPSP uses two novel mechanisms that allow the network operator to adjust the performance of the protocol in terms of energy, latency and success rate on a per-task basis. We emphasize on distributedness, direct or indirect interactions among relatively simple agents, flexibility and robustness. The protocol operates by employing a series of plan &amp; forward phases through which devices self-organize into forwarding groups that propagate data over discovered paths. FPSP performs a limited number of long range, high power data transmissions to collect information regarding the neighboring devices. The acquired information, allows to plan a (parameterizable long by λ) sequence of short range, low power transmissions between nearby particles, based on certain optimization criteria. All particles that decide to respond (based on local criteria) to these long range transmissions enter the forwarding phase during which information is propagated via the acquired plan. Clearly, the duration of the forwarding phases is characterized by the parameter λ, the transmission medium and the processing speed of the devices. In fact the parameter λ provides a mechanism to adjust the protocol performance in terms of the latency-energy trade-off. By reducing λ the latency is reduced at the cost of spending extra energy, while by increasing λ, the energy dissipation is reduced but the latency is increased. To control the success rate-energy trade-off, particles react locally on environment and context changes by using a set of rules that are based on response thresholds that relate individual-level plasticity with network-level resiliency, motivated by the nature-inspired method for dividing labor, a metaphor of social insect behavior for solving problems [1], Each particle has an individual response threshold θ that is related to the "local" density (as observed by the particle, [2]); particles engage in propagation of events when the level of the task-associated stimuli exceeds their thresholds. Let s be the intensity of a stimulus associated with a particular sensing task, set by the human authorities. We adopt the response function Tθ(s) = sn/s n+θn, the probability of performing the task as a function of s, where n &gt; 1 determines the steepness of the threshold. Thus, when θ is small (i.e. the network is sparse) then the response probability increases; when s increases (i.e. for critical sensing tasks) the response probability increases as well. This role-based approach where a selective number of devices do the high cost planning and the rest of the network operates in a low cost state leads to systems that have increased energy efficiency and high fault-tolerance since these long range planning phases allow to bypass obstacles (where no sensors are available) or faulty sensors (that have been disabled due to power failure or other natural events).</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1; Conference name: Seventeenth Annual ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures; Conference date: 18 July 2005 through 20 July 2005; Conference code: 66541&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Annu.

Schools of naval mammals provide the proof that also individual members of the group can achieve higher leveled intelligence independent of the simplicity of their collective behavior. Due to their structurally and functionally modularized brain organization, dolphins are capable of language based communication and learning complex motions by human training. Inspired by dolphins, 3 modules for the behavior controller can be conceptualized. The swarming module optimized by evolutionary methods represents the basic behavior given in the natural environment. The mission module includes extendable sets of behavior primitives that can be structured by reinforcement learning. A knowledge based sensing module can be implemented separately to increase the information reliability. With this approach, subaqueous robot schools can be expected to perform more advanced tasks than just moving as a swarm. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.-U.

Once removed from the energy management loop, the human operator is free to concentrate on higher level task management and data analysis. This paper firstly describes the design, test and construction of an autonomous Ground Recharge Stations (GRS) for battery-powered quadrotor helicopter. In order to incorporate the charging of the quadrotors in the overall swarm behaviour, the focus of the research presented here has been to reduce the charging phase of a single vehicle by developing safer electrical contacts and using a balancer in the charging process. The amount of extra current available from the new design easily pushed the flying-time/charging- time ratio of the quadrotors over 1. The paper then describes a novel approach for the integration of this technology into an energy efficient multi-agent system. The development of a prioritisation function and queuing protocols between the UAVs and GRSs demonstrate an optimised solution to the assignment problem dependent on the mission profile. Numerical experiments show that the system's energy management remains efficient regardless of number and position of the platforms, or nature of the environment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: J.

At the heart of this vision, cascading unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) into a "SWARM" of connectivity nodes offers great flexibility and modularity. The USVs must be able to provide a network of communication data relays, a common tactical picture and mapping for situational awareness. The vehicles must also possess robust communications resistant to jamming, fading and interference while acquiring a high speed data exchange for processing and fusion of information. Reliable wireless network with high data throughput is essential in various military wireless communication systems. While the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication schemes have the potential to exceed the single-input single-output (SISO) Shannon capacity bound, equipping a large number of antennas in a USV is practically impossible. To increase the diversity gain beyond the number of physical antennas, cooperative wireless networks that exploit cooperation among multiple terminals become essential. This paper proposes novel cooperative wireless networking schemes and practical coding designs that provide the USV Swarm reliable wireless links with the overall data throughput and the communication quality significantly exceeding those of the existing non-cooperative systems.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: Y.

In particular, the payload is distributed over multiple satellites belonging to the same mission. Swarms of separated elements cooperating coherently can be used to perform simultaneous scientific measurements of the space environment or implemented as large virtual, sparse apertures in space for high-resolution radar imagery of Earth, interferometry and high gain communications. Advantages of distributed constellations of micro-satellites over traditional single-satellite deployments include increased performance, redundancy and the possibility of reducing the overall cost, in term of launch cost and mission recovery by the substitution of a failed component. These improvements make the implementation of these swarm systems attractive as the functionality is spread over a number of cooperating satellites, thus enabling new missions which would not be possible with a single satellite. The challenges in controlling singularly a large number of elements are, though, enormous: the autonomy of the whole swarm is thus necessary. Swarm- intelligence is the scientific discipline that is expected to give an answer to this technological challenge. Multi-robot autonomous planetary exploration, on-orbit self-assembly, multiple coordinated observations (sensor-webs), are just examples of what could be achieved by the development of a flexible, robust, decentralised, and self-organized system exploiting collective emerging behaviours. The use of swarm robotics is also relevant for advanced mission architectures such as those recently studied by ESA (APIES mission) and NASA (ANTS mission) making use of satellite swarms to explore the asteroid belt or planetary surfaces. In the present paper we present the system design of a single collaborative -satellite swarm component and we analyse the various subsystems including power, propulsion, communication and the relative/absolute position sensors. We give a number of design options for the swarm element, associated to different performance levels, weights and dimensions. Possible in-orbit operations of the pico-satellite swarm architecture are then evaluated based on the Delta-V and the communications/sensing capabilities obtained as a result of the spacecraft system design. In particular, the operational phase is studied relying upon novel techniques based on swarm intelligence and behavioural robotics. These help to cope with the limited capabilities of a swarm element and thus to reach the required global swarm behaviour. Starting from the results achieved during the swarm element design and the in-orbit dynamical simulations, we critically argue on the feasibility of a number of applications recently proposed for in-orbit swarms.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.

As one possible scenario, swarms of collaborating UAVs can be envisioned and allow for more complex missions and scenarios. One essential building block in simultaneously operating several UAVs is the UAS internal and external communication. Ground control station operators need to communicate guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) data, external beneficiaries of the UAS operation need to be provided with obtained sensor data and intelligence. All this requires sophisticated wireless communication networks and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) step into the picture. However, evaluating the performance of different MANETs in a UAS environment is non-trivial: relevant metrics and evaluation procedures have to be established for a simulation based performance prediction during the design phase of a MANET. Unfortunately, published results on MANET performance are not necessarily comparable across different papers, due to differences in the underlying assumptions. Some findings might not even be applicable to a UAS environment. This paper proposes a set of reference scenarios in order to allow for comparable and applicable results in MANET simulations. The presented scenarios mimic realistic UAS missions, both, on the operational side of the participating network nodes, as well as on the network traffic side. The reference scenarios capture the essence of current UAVs and UAS missions in a civil, research, or military context, hence providing the means to simulate different MANET protocols in a UAS setting. © 2008 by the authors.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 1&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: AIAA Model.

The Membership Functions (MFs) of the FLCD algorithm are designed using a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, in order to achieve optimal performance on all the major performance metrics of IP congestion control. The FLCD algorithm achieves better performance when compared to the basic Fuzzy Logic AQM and Random Explicit Marking (REM) algorithms. Since the optimization process is undertaken offline and is based on a single optimization script, the performance of the FLCD algorithm may not be optimal under different network conditions, due to the fact that the IP environment is characterized by dynamic traffic patterns. This paper proposes two online self-learning and organization structures that enable the FLCD algorithm to learn the system conditions and adjust the fuzzy rule base in accordance with prevailing conditions. The self-organized FLCD algorithm is compared with the unorganized FLCD, the basic Fuzzy Logic AQM and the Adaptive Random Early Detection (RED) algorithms using simulations with dynamic traffic patterns. Performance results show that the self-organized FLCD algorithm is more robust than the other algorithms. Compared to the unorganized FLCD, the new scheme improves the UDP traffic delay for short round trip times and also reduces packet loss rates. In terms of jitter, fairness and link utilization, it exhibits a similar performance to the unorganized FLCD algorithm. © Sharif University of Technology.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: D.S.

When there is no effective protocol to save power, then the routing among the nodes is difficult. Underwater Acoustic Sensor networks are mainly used for monitoring instruments, controlling of pollution, recording of changes in climate, natural disaster prediction, search missions and marine life study. The underwater network data transmission among the nodes or in a rout, needs a continuous communication. Else it makes data loss and it cannot be recoverable by any other node or by the base station. In such a situation it is necessary to ensure that the energy efficient network is adopted. In order to provide energy efficiency in routing with successful data transmission, this paper introduces an optimized energy efficient routing protocol [OEERP] via nodes having highest energy in a shortest path where the node highest energy and path least distance is optimized using AFISHS optimization algorithm. FISH is a Bio-inspired optimization algorithm, where it is too dynamic, repetitive and reliable. It provides the optimized highest energy nodes sited in a least distance based shortest path in the network. The simulation result shows the performance evaluation of the proposed AFISHS optimization algorithm than the existing ACO algorithm in various factors like Energy, PDR, and throughput and data loss. In terms of energy, throughput, PDR are increased as 5.5% Joules, 12% kb/sec and 0.6% of packets respectively than the Existing approaches. © 2014 Research India Publications.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931275611&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8fd1b349d5cf5914b3bdd89e32909219</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernardino, A.

Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), also known as IEEE 802.17, is a standard designed for the optimized transport of data traffic over optical fiber ring networks. Its design is to provide the resilience found in SONET/SDH networks but instead of setting up circuit oriented connections, providing a packet based transmission. This is to increase the efficiency of Ethernet and IP services. In this paper, a weighted ring arc-loading problem (WRALP) is considered which arises in engineering and planning of the RPR systems (combinatorial optimization NP- complete problem). Specifically, for a given set of non-split and uni-directional point-to-point demands (weights), the objective is to find the routing for each demand (i.e., assignment of the demand to either clockwise or counter-clockwise ring) so that the maximum arc load is minimized. This paper suggests four variants of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), combined with a Local Search (LS) method to efficient non-split traffic loading on the RPR. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: A. M.

These impediments motivate centralized architectures for multi-UAV planning and coordination. The key problem stems from the need for a human to continuously monitor the UAVs' data streams. We discuss a hierarchical distributed task assignment algorithm, called the team consensus based bundle algorithm, that keeps these four impediments in check. Furthermore, a multi-socket manager (MSM) is presented, which was designed with these four impediments in mind. The MSM is an interface that allows testing of hierarchical and distributed planning architectures that keep these fours factors in check, e.g., the team consensus based bundle algorithm.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference and Exhibit 2011; Conference date: 29 March 2011 through 31 March 2011; Conference code: 97876&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conf. and Exhib. 2011&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference and Exhibit 2011, March 29, 2011 - March 31, 2011&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference and Exhibit 2011, March 29, 2011 - March 31, 2011</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088340711&amp;doi=10.2514%2f6.2011-1537&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=54e5436bd30af7e96244f9e03cb9e17d</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2011-1537</url></text-urls></urls><custom1>St. Louis, MO, United states</custom1><custom3>AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference and Exhibit 2011, March 29, 2011 - March 31, 2011</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hall, S.

Their vision is of a self- synchronizing, horizontally integrated 'swarm' of sensors, processing elements and communication assets that autonomously organize to meet the dynamically evolving ISR needs of future missions/campaigns. This paper describes an analysis workstation that is being constructed to support the evaluation of alternative designs for such a system. Within the workstation a complex adaptive system models the dynamic formation of collection teams while evolutionary algorithms, operating at the agent level, attempt to optimize the global performance of the ISR family of systems by modifying the various agent's responsiveness to attributes of the 'support requests'. Joint MEASURE, a DEVS based Monte Carlo mission effectiveness simulator developed by Lockheed Martin, provides the infrastructure for this workstation enabling the unpredictability of scenario evolution to be an integral element of the optimized solution.

In many situations, stand-off remote-sensing and hazard-interdiction techniques over realistic operational areas are often impractical and difficult to characterize. An alternative approach is to implement adaptive remote-sensing techniques with swarms of mobile agents employing collective behavior for optimization of mapping signatures and positional orientation (registration). We have expanded intelligent control theory using physics-based collective behavior models and genetic algorithms to produce a uniquely powerful implementation of distributed ground-based measurement incorporating both local collective behavior, and inter-operative global optimization for sensor fusion and mission oversight. By using a layered hierarchical control architecture to orchestrate adaptive reconfiguration of semi-autonomous robotic agents, we can improve overall robustness and functionality in dynamic tactical environments without information bottlenecking. In our concept, each sensor is equipped with a miniaturized optical reflectance modulator which is interactively monitored as a remote transponder using a laser communication protocol from a remote mothership or operative. Robot data-sharing at the ground level can be leveraged with global evaluation criteria, including terrain overlays and remote imaging data. Information sharing and distributed intelligence opens up a new class of remote sensing applications in which small single-function autonomous observers at the local level can collectively optimize and measure large scale ground-level signatures. As the need for coverage and the number of agents grows to improve spatial resolution, cooperative behavior orchestrated by a global situational awareness umbrella will be an essential ingredient to offset increasing bandwidth requirements within the net. A system of this type is being developed which will be capable of sensitively detecting, tracking, and mapping spatial distributions of measurement signatures, which are nonstationary or obscured by clutter or interfering obstacles by virtue of adaptive reconfiguration. This methodology is being used to field an adaptive ground-penetrating impulse radar from a superposition of small radiating dipoles for detection of underground structures and to detect/remediate hazardous biological or chemical species in migrating plumes.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Conference name: Proceedings of the 1999 Unattended Ground Sensor Technologies and Applications; Conference date: 8 April 1999 through 9 April 1999; Conference code: 55685; CODEN: PSISD&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: UNATTENDED GROUND SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: UNATTENDED GROUND SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032684825&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.357131&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=79d64375236a6f406a992589a01f6e06</url></web-urls></urls><custom1>Bellingham</custom1><custom3>UNATTENDED GROUND SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Ji, C.</author><author>Yuan, P.</author><author>Li, M.</author><author>Wang, C.</author><author>Wang, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Particle swarm optimization for base station placement in mobile communication</title><secondary-title>Conference Proceeding - IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Conf.

In this paper, we give some novel adaptation to the recent bio-inspired optimization approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to form a suitable algorithm for the base station placement problem. Considering the two most important factors simultaneously, coverage and economy efficiency, we can get a Pareto optimal set by using the Divided Range Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (DRMPSO) which is performed in distributed computing. The Pareto optimal set is a set of solutions which are optimal with respect to constrained conditions and non-inferior to each other. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient and effective, especially for large-scale network design.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 33; Correspondence Address: Y.

This article looks at the emergent properties of the system as a whole based on local spacecraft behaviors, and how these behaviors can be adjusted to achieve mission goals. The significance of this approach is that it frees the ground station from the micromanagement of individual spacecraft (despite the lack of intersatellite links) which is a crucial requirement for the feasibility of future cluster/swarm missions. To understand the system fully, an analysis is presented for simple systems that have different characteristics. Performance is evaluated in terms of intuitive behaviors (greedy, considerate, proactive, and obstinate) that are mathematically defined. This reveals that performance can be steadily improved by making the behaviors more "self-aware." Simulations are then extended to swarms involving larger numbers of spacecraft to demonstrate scalability and more realistic scenarios for practicality.The final contribution of thiswork is to introduce various mechanisms for supervisors, and/or the ground station, to dynamically adjust behavior to achieve load balancing across the cluster.

There is no infrastructure support and sensor nodes communicate with each other only when they are in transmission range. To a greater degree than the terminals found in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) for communications, sensor nodes are resource-constrained, with limited computational processing, bandwidth, memory, and power, and are typically unattended once in operation. Consequently, the level of information exchange among nodes, to support any complex adaptive algorithms to establish network connectivity and optimize throughput, not only deplete those limited resources and creates high overhead in narrowband communications, but also increase network vulnerability to eavesdropping by malicious nodes. Cooperation among nodes, critical to the mission of sensor networks, can thus be disrupted by the inappropriate choice of the method for self-organization. Recent published contributions to the self-configuration of ad hoc sensor networks, e.g., self-organizing mapping and swarm intelligence techniques, have been based on the adaptive control of the cross-layer interactions found in MANET protocols to achieve one or more performance objectives: connectivity, intrusion resistance, power control, throughput, and delay. However, few studies have examined the performance of these algorithms when implemented with the limited resources of WSNs. In this paper, self-organization algorithms for the initiation, operation and maintenance of a network topology from a collection of wireless sensor nodes are proposed that improve the performance metrics significant to WSNs. The intelligent algorithm approach emphasizes low computational complexity, energy efficiency and robust adaptation to change, allowing distributed implementation with the actual limited resources of the cooperative nodes of the network. Extensions of the algorithms from flat topologies to two-tier hierarchies of sensor nodes are presented. Results from a few simulations of the proposed algorithms are compared to the published results of other approaches to sensor network self-organization in common scenarios. The estimated network lifetime and extent under static resource allocations are computed.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Conference name: Intelligent Computing: Theory and Applications IV; Conference date: 17 April 2006 through 18 April 2006; Conference code: 68080; CODEN: PSISD&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33748450077&amp;doi=10.1117%2f12.668020&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=01a7899ad0697a0791b76f9c5ee0ce75</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Felicetti, L.</author><author>Santoni, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nanosatellite swarm missions in low Earth orbit using laser propulsion</title><secondary-title>Aerospace Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aerospace Science and Technology</full-title><abbr-1>Aerosp Sci Technol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>179-187</pages><volume>27</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Orbits</keyword><keyword>Mission architectures</keyword><keyword>Nanosatellites</keyword><keyword>Communication satellites</keyword><keyword>Earth observations</keyword><keyword>Observatories</keyword><keyword>Spacecraft propulsion</keyword><keyword>Mission performance</keyword><keyword>Space research</keyword><keyword>Low earth orbits</keyword><keyword>Ablative materials</keyword><keyword>Atmospheric measurement</keyword><keyword>Atmospheric measurements</keyword><keyword>Beam-powered propulsion</keyword><keyword>Earth observation</keyword><keyword>Laser propulsion</keyword><keyword>Propulsion technique</keyword><keyword>Pulsed laser applications</keyword><keyword>Pulsed laser propulsion</keyword><keyword>Source separation</keyword><keyword>Very low Earth orbit</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>12709638 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ast.2012.08.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many missions could benefit from the exploitation of very low height orbits, including Earth observation, atmospheric measurement and space weather research missions. However satellite's lifetime decreases very quickly when the mission requires to orbit into the dense layers of the atmosphere. The mission performance could be enhanced using innovative propulsion techniques, counteracting the effect of atmospheric drag. Among these, laser propulsion potentially offers great weight and power savings, obtained by separating the propulsion system energy source from the propelled satellite. The energy source for the propulsion system is a pulsed laser beam generated remotely, while only collecting mirrors and ablative material are necessary on the target spacecraft. A mission architecture for very low altitude nanosatellite swarms using a space-based pulsed laser propulsion is described. A simplified laser-sustained re-orbiting maneuver sequence is proposed, leading to a straightforward evaluation of the maneuver times, showing that the laser propulsion system is suitable for low altitude nanosatellite missions.

They navigate by overhead satellites, synchronize their flight paths with other vehicles, swarm over hostile territory and attack multiple targets. Studying these engagements with high-fidelity constructive simulations has become an important task of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S). The simulation framework Computer Aided Design of Aerospace Concepts (CADAC) has its roots in FORTRAN code that dates back to the 1960s and was used by industry and the U.S. Air Force to simulate aerospace vehicles in all flight environments. To adapt CADAC to the new environment, a complete rewrite was carried out in C++, taking advantage of object-oriented programming techniques. The architecture of CADAC++ is based on the hierarchical structure of inherited classes. The vehicles (aircraft, missiles, satellites or ground targets), inherit the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) equations of motion from the classes 'Flat6' or 'Round6', conveying either the flat or elliptical Earth model. In turn, these classes inherit the communication structure from the base class 'Cadac'. The components of the vehicle, e.g., aerodynamics, propulsion and autopilot, are represented by modules, which are member functions of the vehicle class. Communication among the modules occurs by protected module-variable arrays. Every instantiated vehicle object is encapsulated with its methods and data. To communicate between vehicles, data packets are loaded onto a global data bus for recall by other vehicles. Input occurs by ASCII file and output is compatible with CADAC Studio, a plotting and data processing package. CADAC++ is chiefly an engineering tool for refining the components of the primary vehicle and exploring its performance as it interacts (possibly repeatedly instantiated) with the multi-object environment. Its modular structure enables reuse of component models across simulations. In the 10 years of development, CADAC++ based constructive simulations have been built for many types of aerospace vehicles and integrated with mission-level simulations. © 2012 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.&#xD;&#xD;Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: P.

The main goal is to explore the use of MAS to simulate spatial scenarios based on modelling multi-actor decision-making within a spatial planning process. We demonstrate MAS that consists of agents representing organizations and interest groups involved in an urban allocation problem during a land use planning process. The multi-actor based decision-making is modelled by generating beliefs and preferences of actors about the location of and relation between spatial objects. This allows each agent to confront these beliefs and preferences with it's own desires and with that of other agents. The MAS loosely resembles belief, desire and intentions architecture. Based on a case study for a hypothetical land use planning situation in a study area in the Netherlands we discuss the potential and limitations of the MAS to build models that enable spatial planners to include the 'actor factor' in their analysis and design of spatial scenarios. In addition, our experiments revealed the need for further research on the representation of spatial objects and reasoning, learning and communication about allocation problems using MAS. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the planning horizon spans tens of years, a certain amount of uncertainty is inherent in forecasting the deteriorating process and the costs and effects of maintenance actions. This paper proposes a multiobjective simulation optimization framework to establish the trade-off among the expected values of life-cycle maintenance cost and of the performance measures. The trade-off information, represented as the Pareto front, gives planners sufficient flexibility to respond to various needs. The optimization is performed by a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, while MonteCarlo simulation is used to model the uncertainties. To alleviate the computational burden, the proposed framework is implemented in a parallel computing platform, where three programming paradigms (master-slave, island, and diffusion) are developed to distribute computation across processors and to control interprocessor communication. The validity of the proposed framework, along with the parallel paradigms, is investigated through a practical case. It is shown statistically that the proposed MOPSO algorithm is superior to the well-known nondominating sorting genetic algorithm II as the former can obtain a better Pareto front, whose convergence and diversity are measured together by the hypervolume indicator. Both the island and diffusion paradigms, being loosely synchronous, exhibit high efficiency and good scalability as they achieve superlinear speedups. The island paradigm outperforms the other two in terms of improved solution quality within fixed time. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: I.-T.

Briefly, the greater the number of processors, the less the chance of error and the better the analogical match that can be found in the processing time allowed. Clearly, any practical science of design should allow the human in the loop to do what he/she does best while at the same time utilize the robot to do what it does best. Such an eminently practical symbiosis is based on the science of randomization as defined by Chaitin, Kolmogorov, Rubin, Solomonoff, and Uspenskii [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Here, repetitive or symmetric actions such as testing evolutionary alternatives are carried out by a fast computer, while novel or -random actions such as that of providing a model definition are realized by the human. Autonomous behavior may be determined by the interaction of simple heuristics, rather than through the design of complex software that is difficult to maintain. The emergent behavior of simple heuristics is not only universal, but potentially at least as complex as that of any other design for the realization of software control systems. While any autonomous vehicle equipped with suitable sensors can be autonomously guided by an appropriate set of heuristics, the acquisition of such a base has proven to be elusive to date. This document provides a forum for some preliminary results in the area of knowledge amplification as well as a setting for projected future research in the area of intelligence. The problems encountered in developing a set of heuristics to guide an autonomous vehicle include: Rules are too crisp and not sufficiently flexible to cover real-world situations. No one knows all of the rules needed in advance. Fuzzy logic only addresses quantitative aspects of the rules; whereas, the qualitative aspects are at least as important. Conventional rule acquisition is slow and otherwise impractical. Neural networks cannot plan effectively. Neural networks cannot learn nearly fast enough to be used in conjunction with a human trainer. Cases cannot be autonomously adapted, which limits the applicability of CBR here. Systems do not grow their knowledge bases by sharing, which limits the acquisition of knowledge by swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Algorithmic control aspects need to be processed separately and locally. No one would be a pilot if they lacked common sense. They can learn how to fly, but without common sense, they are preordained to fail. Yet, our predecessors have sought to build UAVs that are lacking in this most critical capability - presumably because they are of the mistaken belief that computers can never exhibit commonsense reasoning beyond that for which they are explicitly programmed. However, knowledge amplifiers, known as KASERs, have been designed and patented by one of the authors [6] and elsewhere, which allow for the symmetric expansion of a knowledge base - enabling heuristic programs to reason by analogy - just like human pilots. Applications for autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles such as the UAVs that support the US military in reconnaissance missions (Predator and the GlobalHawk, for example) or could support our civilian forces using autonomous robot colonies (in rescue missions such as the events surrounding the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City bombing, or in homeland security, for example) continue to spurn new research and development efforts in intelligent agents, light-weight material, fuel-cell based propulsion, hybrid engine designs, smart sensor networks, secure wireless communication networks, and energy-efficient computing architectures. Further, with the advent of advances in nanotechnology and microsystems, several research teams continue to investigate the integration of such technologies for small swarms of AVs or SAVs for military, commercial, and civilian applications. SSC-PAC has designed, developed, patented, and in some cases transitioned intelligent systems, which serve to automate the creation, testing, and maintenance of complex software systems. Subsequently, the co-authors have collaborated on the construction of a Cognitive KASER for learning and have investigated its application to such areas as web searching and decision support architectures. A brief summary of the work in knowledge amplification is provided in Section III. In summary, in order to test a new learning approach that can bestow intelligence on a system, based upon human (tutor) - robot (student) interaction, we are working jointly to design an intelligent system architecture, based on the KASER, and plan to implement the methodology on an aerial vehicle (a helicopter), which will execute several maneuvers such as basic hovering, steep approach, confined area approach, and basic altitude flying. The software to perform these maneuvers will be developed using two methods (teach mode with a human-in-the-loop) and classical control. Then, the knowledge amplification system will autonomously generate another set of software, which will then be tested and compared to the execution of the baseline two software codes using the same helicopter flight scenarios. We anticipate that such complex functional real-time software can be most cost-effectively written through the use of a software-writing system embodying knowledge amplification. © 2011 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings.

Generating architectures for a SoS is a multi-objective optimization problem with large number of variables and constraints. The paper presents several of computational intelligence techniques that can generate SoS architectures, such as genetic algorithms (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with Type 2 Fuzzy logic nets. The Maritime search and rescue (SAR) was used as a SoS domain scenario to both implement and demonstrate the architecting methodology. SAR utilizes a variety of systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), coordination command control, communication systems and other larger manned vessels. The proposed methodology delivers SoS architects of SAR missions the ability to exploit the interdependence among all systems as well as individual system's inherent characteristics to satisfy stakeholders' desired attributes. The architect is thus able to design architectures that are robust, efficient, net-centric, and affordable. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, most studies have mainly focused on protocols for applications in which network performance assurances are not considered essential. With the emergence of mission-critical applications, performance control mechanisms are considered of prime importance. Performance control can be carried out by robust congestion control approaches that aim to keep the network operational under varying network conditions. Swarm intelligence is successfully employed to combat congestion by mimicking the collective behavior of bird flocks. In this way, the emerging global behavior of minimum congestion is achieved collectively. A flock-based congestion control (Flock-CC) approach was proposed in the past. This paper presents a new, simpler Flock-CC approach. Performance evaluations focus on parameter setting and on comparative studies between the new and the earlier version of Flock-CC. © 2011 ACM.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: P.

In this paper we identify scaling issues and present some simple results in the domain of individual mobile robots, as well as teams, swarms, etc., deployed on sensing missions. Since most robot-based sensing missions anticipate mini-, micro-, and nano-scale robots, our explicit examples focus on scaling-down of existing humanscale robot designs and concepts. However the principles articulated apply equally to scaling-up situations. The topic is introduced via a simple example that shows why scaling-down of mobile robots that carry their own energy source will generally prove impractical: to obtain reasonable operating times it will rather be necessary to develop small robots into which energy can be beamed, or which can forage for energy sources in the environment. From this concrete illustrative example, the paper moves on to a higher level discussion of robot architecture and the applicability of scaling principles, to varying degrees, to all the modules, i.e., it is not exclusively a mobility issue. There follows a short discussion of how changes of scale are not inherently problematic, but to the contrary, in many cases suitable scale change provides the key to solving a difficult engineering problem. The final section is a quantitative example in which design and operating parameters of the robotic nodes of a sensor network are considered from the perspective of operating time limited by the energy cost of node-to-node communication. This example powerfully illustrates a system in which fairly modest changes contemplated range of engineering parameters result in enormous changes in the anticipated operating time of the system.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: M.

Future missions involve sending spacecraft and robots to harsh environments, where resilience is necessary for the survival of the mission. In addition, distances and communication lead times between the spacecraft and Earth necessitate much of the mission operation being autonomous. We have been conducting research on the development of autonomous space exploration missions based on principles from Autonomic Computing (AC), whereby the mission is imbued with self-management capabilities. Such missions will involve several, rather than single, spacecraft, robots or other devices, operating in collaboration. We describe one such concept mission, ANTS (Autonomous Nano-Technology Swarm), which involves a number of sub-missions that are self-similar. Our work in this, and other future missions, has involved the use of techniques from AC for building in self-management, and ultimately self-governance. We have also explored the use of formal methods to gain confidence in the correct behavior of the mission. Since both the physical devices which will be used for exploration, and the software that is essential for their successful deployment, lend themselves to a product-line approach, we have been exploiting techniques from software product-line engineering, in particular Multi-Agent System Product Lines (MAS-PL) and Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL). © 2011 IEEE.</abstract><research-notes>Export Date: 22 November 2023; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

The learning factor is dynamically adjusted according to the inertia weight parameters, and the particle swarm optimization parameters are selected in combination with the setting of the maximum velocity parameters. The individual optimal particle is selected by using the dominant relationship between the individual particles, and the optimization of the optimal particle is completed by combining the selection requirements of the global optimal particle. We design the v2x communication implementation scheme, obtain the traffic flow information of urban rail transit, build the signal input and output model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm, obtain the output feedback signal, and determine the planning scale of urban rail transit network, so as to build the urban rail transit network planning model and complete the urban rail transit network planning. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the utilization rate of urban rail transit network planning, effectively control the change of network signal amplitude, and reduce the repetition rate of urban rail transit network planning.  2022 Ning Yu.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/2401333</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Ming</author><author>Tang, Hong</author><author>Zhang, Peng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Survey of path planning technologies for robots swarm</title><secondary-title>Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology</full-title><abbr-1>Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>127-138</pages><volume>43</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Computer architecture</keyword><keyword>Swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>Biomimetics</keyword><keyword>Motion planning</keyword><keyword>Robot programming</keyword><keyword>Learning systems</keyword><keyword>Cluster computing</keyword><keyword>Simulation platform</keyword><keyword>Intelligent robots</keyword><keyword>Autonomous agents</keyword><keyword>Scalability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10012486</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.11887/j.cn.202101017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As an important carrier of group intelligence, robot clusters have also received a lot of research and development and more and more applications.

In the medical domain, UAV can play a vital role in the fast and efficient delivery of first aid and medical supplies. In the current study, safe and smooth UAV navigation from the initial position to the medical emergency location was achieved with optimal path planning through a proposed algorithm. On the notification of patient about his health condition using GSM band, doctor drone was sent from the nearest hospital facility. To avoid traffic congestion the doctor drone provides medical assistance with minimum computational time and transportation cost. The vehicle routing was carried out through proposed algorithms i.e., capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The comparison between the algorithms was carried out at different vehicle capacities and numbers. The CVRP was found to outperform other algorithms with a runtime of 0.06 sec and cost of 419 at vehicle capacity 10, which is 50% less having the same number of the vehicles but increasing the capacities to 20. The results indicate that the effective path planning method could be applied to provide medical aid in real-time with efficacy.

The Government of India is doing loads of works on online health schemes such as "Ayushman Bharat Yojana." The proposed research technique may be incorporated with existing online portal for secured data transmission. In this proposed methodology, nature-inspired biological algorithm based on salp swarm has been deployed to generate 256-bits session key for secure transmission of medical information. Arruda E.F. et al. have proposed optimal testing policies for diagnosing patients with intermediary probability of disease in the journal of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (Elsevier: June 2019 (Vol. 97)) with no detailed diagnosis of unknown diseases. Moreover, online expert opinion with secured data communication was not present at their technique. This proposed work resolves the stated issues by encrypting the patients fingerprints with lower order session key, and higher order is used for IDEA encrypting the signals. The resultant of both round of encryption is transmitted to a group of known physicians with threshold limits. Several quality testings such as key sensitivity, signal sensitivity, chi-square, session key space, and statistical tests were carried out, and results are compared with existing benchmark techniques.

This paper aims to construct and analyze the plane space mode of urban culture based on the particle swarm cultural scientific computing algorithm. This article first explains the concept of urban cultural space. Urban cultural space uses urban spatial structure as a media carrier and uses urban cultural time for vertical extension and development; then we proposed the particle swarm cultural scientific calculation algorithm and gave the particle swarm algorithm flowchart; then based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the evaluation of the configuration performance of urban cultural facilities is researched and discussed, and at the same time, the evolution law of urban spatial morphology is explored based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The particle swarm algorithm is a random search algorithm based on group cooperation developed by simulating the foraging behavior of birds. Urban cultural space is the development of urban space based on urban culture. It plays a special and important role in urban cultural development and urban space planning. According to the statistics of the survey and research results, the utilization rate of city-level cultural facilities in City A is 77, the utilization rate of district-level cultural facilities is 72, the utilization rate of street-community cultural facilities is 69, and the overall evaluation score is 70. It shows that there are significant differences in the actual use of cultural facilities, so it is particularly important to eliminate the differences in the use of cultural facilities between urban and rural areas. In the exploration of the law of urban spatial morphology evolution, it is found that the number of college students, total real estate investment, urban population, and total commercial housing sales have a significant impact on urban spatial expansion and evolution.  2022 Jiayong Yu and Qi Li.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/9838782</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashwini, K.</author><author>Vijayakumar, M.

To investigate the behavior of swarm intelligent agents in ambient environment with respect to motivation, coordination and performance. To check how performance of agents in a group varies with proper motivation and coordination. Since group of agents are performing together the intelligence performance exhibiting from the group is always greater than individual intelligence performance. The question is, what exactly is happening in these groups that their performance is superior to the individuals? With better group members, performance of the group will be better. What makes the individual member better?

Hence, how to optimize the communication protocol and extend the system lifetime is crucial to ensure the stability of system. However, the existing studies focused primarily on cluster-based or multihop protocols individually, which are ineffective in coping with the complex communication scenarios in the railway wireless monitoring system (RWMS). This study proposes a hybrid protocol which combines the cluster-based and multihop protocols (CMCP) to minimize and balance the energy consumption in different sections of the RWMS. In the first hierarchy, the total energy consumption is minimized by optimizing the cluster quantities in the cluster-based protocol and the number of hops and the corresponding hop distances in the multihop protocol. In the second hierarchy, the energy consumption is balanced through rotating the cluster head (CH) in the subnetworks and further optimizing the hops and the corresponding hop distances in the backbone network. On this basis, the system lifetime is maximized with the minimum and balance energy consumption among the sensors. Furthermore, the hybrid particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) are adopted to optimize the energy consumption from the two-layer hierarchy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CMCP is verified in the simulation. The performances of the proposed CMCP in system lifetime, residual energy, and the corresponding variance are all superior to the LEACH protocol widely applied in the previous research. The effective protocol proposed in this study can facilitate the application of the wireless monitoring network in the railway system and enhance safety operation of the railway.  2018 Xiaoping Ma et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/9516342</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Pu</author><author>Yan, Fei</author><author>Liu, Zhao</author><author>Cheng, Guoda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communication-constrained task allocation of heterogeneous UAVs</title><secondary-title>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</full-title><abbr-1>Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica</abbr-1></periodical><volume>42</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</keyword><keyword>Cooperative communication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10006893</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7527/S1000-6893.2021.25844</electronic-resource-num><abstract>When the heterogeneous multi-UAVs are performing the missions of cooperative reconnaissance and attack, there exists the problem of local task allocation under the constraints of communication distance and time delay. In this paper, a distributed multi-UAV task allocation method is proposed based on the contract net protocol. First, an optimization model of the local task allocation when heterogeneous multi-UAVs discover a new target is established. An information consensus algorithm is designed for the local UAV communication network to solve the conflict in the task announcement process. Then, a coalition formation and resource management method are proposed, so that the UAVs in the coalition can consume the resources in a more balanced way. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem of task allocation of heterogeneous multi-UAV reconnaissance and attack mission under communication constraints, and can obtain the maximum system utility.  2021, Beihang University Aerospace Knowledge Press.

In the traditional architecture for a software-defined network (SDN), the controller commonly uses a general routing algorithm such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), which chooses the shortest path for communication. This may cause the largest amount of network traffic, especially in large-scale environments. In this paper, we present the design for a novel SDN-based four-tier architecture for scalable secure routing and load balancing. In Tier 1, user authentication is conducted using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC); this avoids unnecessary loads from unauthorized users. In Tier 2, packet classification is performed based on the packet characteristics using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP), and packets are placed into three individual queues. In Tier 3, scalable secure routing is achieved by selecting the optimal path using the improved particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization algorithms. With these optimization algorithms, we can adaptively change the number of users, the number of switches, and other parameters. In Tier 4, the recommended secure cluster (multicontroller) management is accomplished using an algorithm that employs modified k-means clustering and a recurrent neural network. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is also proposed for updating the controller information. Experimental results are analyzed using the OMNeT++ network simulator, and the evaluated performance displayed improvement over a variety of existing methods in terms of response time (50% to 60%), load (55%), execution time (3.2%), throughput (9.8%), packet loss rate (1.02%), end-to-end delay (50%), and bandwidth consumption (45%). 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dac.5020</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Na</author><author>Chen, Ke-Fan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aeronautic swarm cloud network oriented MAC protocol for aviation data link</title><secondary-title>Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics</full-title><abbr-1>Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1164-1175</pages><volume>38</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing</keyword><keyword>Internet protocols</keyword><keyword>Medium access control</keyword><keyword>Frequency division multiple access</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1001506X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3969/j.issn.1001-506X.2016.05.30</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To meet the new network demand of aeronautic swarm operation in the future, a new concept named as "aeronautic swarm cloud network" is proposed, and the coupling mechanism between the communication and mission demand is designed which provides the reference for the concrete technique of aeronautic swarm network. Based on the concept and mechanism, a media access control (MAC) protocol combined with orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based variable-width channel allocation is designed.

Actuator faults such as loss of effectiveness and bias fault are mainly considered. Firstly, based on graph theory, an adaptive fault-tolerant time-varying formation tracking control protocol is constructed with adaptive updating parameters and the relative information of the neighboring UAVs, and the feasibility condition for formation tracking is given. The control protocol does not depend on the information of the actuator fault boundary by using adaptive technology. Then, by constructing a reasonable Lyapunov function and solving the algebraic Riccati equation, the stability of the designed controller is proved. For UAV swarm systems with switching topologies and actuator faults, the formation tracking control protocol designed is adopted to enable the followers form the desired time-varying formation and track the leader's status at the same time. Finally, the simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.  2021 Ran Zhen et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/5519243</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Taegyun</author><author>Kim, Seungkeun</author><author>Suk, Jinyoung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Formation flight simulation and flight test of multiple ducted-fan UAV</title><secondary-title>Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems</abbr-1></periodical><pages>398-406</pages><volume>25</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Software testing</keyword><keyword>Open source software</keyword><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Flight simulators</keyword><keyword>Controllers</keyword><keyword>Degrees of freedom (mechanics)</keyword><keyword>Aircraft landing</keyword><keyword>Free flight</keyword><keyword>VTOL/STOL aircraft</keyword><keyword>Python</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>19765622</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5302/J.ICROS.2019.19.0047</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study investigates the formation flight of multiple ducted-fan UAVs using Wi-Fi communication for potential coordinated or collaborative missions.

Moreover, mobile sinks ought to first collect data from nodes which have very important and dense data so that packet collision and loss can be prevented at an advanced level. For these purposes, the present paper proposes a new mobile path planning protocol by introducing priority-ordered dependent nonparametric trees (PoDNTs) for WSNs. Unlike traditional clustered or swarm intelligence topology-based routing methods, a topology which has hierarchical and dependent infinite tree structure provides a robust link connection between nodes, making it easier to reselect ancestor nodes (ANs). The proposed priority-ordered infinite trees are sampled in the specific time frames by introducing new equations and hierarchically associated with their child nodes starting from the root node. Hence, the nodes with the highest priority and energy that belong to the constructed tree family are selected as ANs with an opportunistic approach. A mobile sink simply visits these ANs to acquire data from all nodes in the network and return to where it started. As a result, the route traveled is assigned as the mobile path for the current round. We have performed comprehensive performance analysis to illustrate the effectiveness of the present study using NS-2 simulation environment. The present routing protocol has achieved better results than the other algorithms over various performance metrics. 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dac.4449</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Chuanxin</author><author>Wu, Changzhi</author><author>Chai, Jian</author><author>Wang, Xiangyu</author><author>Yang, Xinmin</author><author>Lee, Jae-Myung</author><author>Kim, Mi Jeong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decomposition-based multi-objective firefly algorithm for RFID network planning with uncertainty</title><secondary-title>Applied Soft Computing Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Soft Computing Journal</full-title><abbr-1>Applied Soft Computing Journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>549-564</pages><volume>55</volume><keywords><keyword>Genetic algorithms</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Numerical methods</keyword><keyword>Multiobjective optimization</keyword><keyword>Radio frequency identification (RFID)</keyword><keyword>DEPLOYMENT</keyword><keyword>TRACKING</keyword><keyword>Bioluminescence</keyword><keyword>Screening</keyword><keyword>Decomposition</keyword><keyword>Identification probability</keyword><keyword>MOEA/D</keyword><keyword>Multi-objective firefly algorithm</keyword><keyword>RFID network planning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>JUN 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1568-4946, 1872-9681</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.asoc.2017.02.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Radio frequency identification (RFID) is widely used for item identification and tracking. Due to the limited communication range between readers and tags, how to configure a RFID system in a large area is important but challenging. To configure a RFID system, most existing results are based on cost minimization through using 0/1 identification model. In practice, the system is interfered by environment and probabilistic model would be more reliable. To make sure the quality of the system, more objectives, such as interference and coverage, should be considered in addition to cost. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic-based multi-objective optimization model to address these challenges. The objectives to be optimized include number of readers, interference level and coverage of tags. A decomposition based firefly algorithm is designed to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. Virtual force is integrated into random walk to guide readers moving in order to enhance exploitation. Numerical simulations are introduced to demonstrate and validate our proposed method. Comparing with existing methods, such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization approaches, our proposed method can achieve better performance in terms of quality metric and generational distance under the same computational environment. However, the spacing metric of the proposed method is slightly inferior to those compared methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the performance of the VANET depends on the routing protocol in accord with the delay and throughput requirements. Many of the routing protocols have been extensively studied in the literature. Although there are exemptions, they escalate research challenges in traffic aware routing (TAR) protocol of VANET. This paper introduces the fractional glowworm swarm optimization (FGWSO) for the TAR protocol of VANET in an urban scenario that can identify the optimal path for the vehicle with less traffic density and delay time. The proposed FGWSO searches the optimal routing path based on the fitness function formulated in this paper. Fractional glowworm swarm optimization is the combination of the GWSO and fractional theory. Moreover, exponential weighted moving average is utilized to predict the traffic density and the speed of the vehicle, which is utilized as the major constraints in the fitness function of the optimization algorithm to find the optimal traffic aware path. Simulation of FGWSO shows the significant improvement with a minimal end-to-end delay of 6.6395seconds and distance of 17.3962m, respectively, in comparison with the other existing routing approaches. The simulation also validates the optimality of the proposed TAR protocol.

Holonic manufacturing systems (HMS) provide a flexible and decentralised manufacturing environment to accommodate changes dynamically. HMS is based on the notion of holon, an autonomous, co-operative and intelligent entity which is able to collaborate with other holons to complete the tasks. HMS requires a robust coordination and collaboration mechanism to allocate available resources to achieve the production goals. In this paper, a basic integrated process planning and scheduling system, which is applicable to the holonic manufacturing systems is presented. A basic architecture of holonic manufacturing system is proposed from the viewpoint of the process planning and the scheduling systems. Here, the process planning is defined as a process to select suitable machining sequences of machining features and suitable operation sequences of machining equipments, taking into consideration the short-term and long-term capacities of machining equipments. A fuzzy inference system (FIS), in choosing alternative machines for integrated process planning and scheduling of a job shop in HMS, is presented. Instead of choosing alternative machines randomly, machines are being selected based on the machine's capacity. The mean time for failure (MTF) values are input in a fuzzy inference mechanism, which outputs the machine reliability. The machine is then being penalised based on the fuzzy output. The most reliable machine will have the higher priority to be chosen. In order to overcome the problem of un-utilisation machines, sometimes faced by unreliable machine, the hybrid particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with differential evolution (DE) has been applied to balance the load for all the machines. Simulation studies show that the proposed system can be used as an effective way of choosing machines in integrated process planning and scheduling.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09511920903207472</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soumya, J.</author><author>Tiwary, Srijan</author><author>Chattopadhyay, Santanu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Area-performance trade-off in floorplan generation of Application-Specific Network-on-Chip with soft cores</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Systems Architecture</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>61</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Energy utilization</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Economic and social effects</keyword><keyword>Distributed computer systems</keyword><keyword>Integrated circuit design</keyword><keyword>Network-on-chip</keyword><keyword>Programmable logic controllers</keyword><keyword>Routers</keyword><keyword>Servers</keyword><keyword>Aspect ratio</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>13837621</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.sysarc.2014.11.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Application-Specific Network-on-Chip (ASNoC) synthesis has found increasing significance in developing System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions for applications. This paper integrates various issues in the ASNoC synthesis process - availability of soft cores (with area and aspect ratio regulations), floorplanning for the whole NoC and determining router locations. Apart from attaching primary routers to the cores, it also introduces necessary extra secondary routers, so that the inter-router link length can be kept within a specified upper bound. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based formulation has been made to solve this integrated problem with a trade-off between the overall chip-area and the network communication overhead. Experimentation has been carried out with a set of well-known benchmarks. Apart from static communication cost, throughput, latency and energy consumption of the approach have been computed. The approach compares favourably with some recent approaches reported in the literature.  2014 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with the past, people's pursuit of spiritual and cultural life also makes our education field usher in a huge development to adapt to the changes in the context of the times. But, at the same time, the development of labor education is gradually being downplayed by people, resulting in a series of problems such as people preferring comfort and not working. Aiming at this common problem, this paper will use the ant colony algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm in the computer intelligent algorithm to optimize the way of labor education. It includes the principle and basic process of the ant colony algorithm, the establishment of the mathematical model of the original ant colony algorithm, and the improved algorithm of the ant colony algorithm. The research results of the optimization method of labor education showed the following: when the number of ant colonies reaches 51, the number of iterations of the algorithm will be the least, and the corresponding shortest path is also the best solution; when the combination of pheromone intensity and volatility factor is 3, the optimal solution can be quickly found, and the algorithm inflection point of MMAS is 44.82. From the research results, it can be seen that the computer intelligent algorithm has a good choice for the optimization of labor education and can achieve a major breakthrough in the traditional model of labor education.  2022 Liming Huang et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/8740978</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Liping</author><author>Zhao, Ruichuan</author><author>Wu, Wenzheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Based on Improved Artificial Neural Network Sewage Monitoring Alarm System Method</title><secondary-title>Scientific Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Programming</full-title><abbr-1>Scientific Programming</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6397478</pages><volume>2022</volume><keywords><keyword>Monitoring</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>MATLAB</keyword><keyword>Optimal control systems</keyword><keyword>C (programming language)</keyword><keyword>Target tracking</keyword><keyword>Water quality</keyword><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>WATER</keyword><keyword>Biochemical oxygen demand</keyword><keyword>Dissolution</keyword><keyword>Dissolved oxygen</keyword><keyword>Effluent treatment</keyword><keyword>Effluents</keyword><keyword>Sewage</keyword><keyword>Water pollution</keyword><keyword>Water pollution control</keyword><keyword>REDUCTION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>SEP 14 2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1058-9244, 1875-919X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2022/6397478</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sewage discharge has become a key issue affecting the quality of the water environment, and how to effectively monitor and manage sewage discharge behavior has become a key factor to avoid water pollution and improve water quality. However, the current domestic sewage discharge monitoring system is not perfect, resulting in the lack of effective monitoring of enterprise sewage discharge by regulatory authorities, which provides an opportunity for enterprises to steal discharge. In the background of sewage treatment plant, the comprehensive design of sewage monitoring and alarm system is carried out based on the idea of physical information fusion. The design adopts a four-layer information physical architecture, which is divided into four parts: perception communication, fusion processing, push, and execution. In the fusion treatment part, the neural network intelligent algorithm is used to predict the dissolved oxygen, and the oxygen delivery is adjusted according to the predicted value to achieve accurate aeration and optimize the effluent quality. The push and execution parts adopt multiparameter monitoring to realize the smooth operation of equipment and ensure the system security. A new optimal control strategy of dissolved oxygen based on neural network is proposed. Through a large number of experiments and historical data, the intake index and dissolved oxygen value of the aeration tank under the condition of optimal outlet water are obtained as samples. According to the sample training, the BP neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to achieve accurate prediction of dissolved oxygen under different inlet water conditions. The smooth operation of sewage treatment equipment is accomplished by the lower machine and the upper machine. In sewage treatment, each process section collects the equipment status in strict accordance with the order of sewage monitoring facilities. Then the communication network between the upper computer and the lower computer and the sensor is designed. The lower machine adopts PLC as the core, programming PLC through STEP7, and uses PID algorithm to control dissolved oxygen. The PC is developed in C language, so as to realize user login, real-time data display, over-limit fault alarm, report query, user management, etc. The PC integrates MATLAB neural network on the platform to predict dissolved oxygen through mixed programming quantity. The sewage alarm system based on improved artificial neural network is sensitive and has excellent performance. It provides a new idea for intelligent sewage detection and real-time monitoring.  2022 Liping Chen et al.</abstract><research-notes>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2023 Elsevier Inc.</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6397478</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kratzke, Nane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Smuggling multi-cloud support into cloud-native applications using elastic container platforms</title><tertiary-title>CLOSER 2017 - Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science, CLOSER 2017, April 24, 2017 - April 26, 2017</full-title></periodical><pages>29-42</pages><keywords><keyword>Containers</keyword><keyword>Process control</keyword><keyword>Cloud computing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>SciTePress</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5220/0006230700570070</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Elastic container platforms (like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos) fit very well with existing cloudnative application architecture approaches. So it is more than astonishing, that these already existing and open source available elastic platforms are not considered more consequently in multi-cloud research. Elastic container platforms provide inherent multi-cloud support that can be easily accessed. We present a solution proposal of a control process which is able to scale (and migrate as a side effect) elastic container platforms across different public and private cloud-service providers. This control loop can be used in an execution phase of self-Adaptive auto-scaling MAPE loops (monitoring, analysis, planning, execution). Additionally, we present several lessons learned from our prototype implementation which might be of general interest for researchers and practitioners. For instance, to describe only the intended state of an elastic platform and let a single control process take care to reach this intended state is far less complex than to define plenty of specific and necessary multi-cloud aware workflows to deploy, migrate, terminate, scale up and scale down elastic platforms or applications. 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

What would this "living matter" mean for architecture and the way we perceive the built environment? This paper looks briefly at current concepts and investigations in regards to programmable matter that occupy various areas of architectural research.

The network topology is changing due to the mobility of the UAVs and the sensor nodes, so the design of efficient data collection protocols is a major concern. We address such high dynamic network and propose two mechanisms: prioritized-based contact-duration frame selection mechanism (PCdFS), and prioritized-based multiple contact-duration frame selection mechanisms (PMCdFS) to build collision-free scheduling and balance the nodes between the multi-UAV respectively. Based on the two mechanisms, we proposed a Balance algorithm to conduct the collision-free communication between the mobile nodes and the multi-UAVs. Two key design ideas for a Balance algorithm are: (a) no need of higher priority for those nodes that have lower transmission rate between them and the UAV and (b) improve the communication opportunity for those nodes that have shorter contact duration with the UAVs. We demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms through extensive simulations, and real experiments. These experiments using 15 mobile nodes at a path with 10 intersections and 1 island, present that network fairness is efficiently enhanced. We also confirm the applicability of proposed algorithms in a challenging and realistic scenario through numerous experiments on a path at Tongji campus in Shanghai, China.  2020 by the authors.

For this purpose we introduce the concept of mobile relay stations, which form a chain between the base station and the explorer and forward all communication. In order to cope with the mobility of the explorer, relay stations must adapt their positions. We investigate strategies which allow the relay stations to self-organize in order to maintain a chain of small length. For a plane without obstacles, the optimal positions are on a line connecting the base station with the explorer; in a setting with obstacles it is a curve around some of the obstacles. Our goal is to keep the relay stations as close to this line/curve as possible. A crucial requirement for strategies is that they are able to work with imprecise or without localization and odometry information. Furthermore, strategies should be local, i.e., relay stations should not need to know about the state of the system as a whole. The performance measures for strategies are the number of relay stations used (in comparision to the optimal number) and the allowed speed of the explorer (in comparision to its maximum attainable speed). We contribute by analyzing the performance of an already known strategy Go-To-The-Middle. This strategy assumes a very weak robot model and needs hardly any localization information, but sacrifices perfomance. Our main contribution is a new strategy, the Chase-Explorer strategy, and its analysis. It needs more advanced robots than Go-To-The-Middle, but achieves near-optimal performance. We further extend it to exploring terrains with obstacles.

Due to high mobility, such a dynamic network faces frequent changes in network topology, resulting in poor wireless link quality and even frequent disconnection. UAVs' computational capability is also bound to a limited threshold. Therefore, it is important to design a routing protocol that works in a lightweight and adaptive manner. We propose an intelligent routing protocol for Multi-UAV Networks that ensure minimum hops to the destination and better link quality by employing the Q-learning technique. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated through the OPNET simulator. A preliminary result shows that it can improve the routing performance in terms of the end-to-end delivery and packet delivery ratio, compared to the de facto ad hoc routing protocol.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (IEEE ICAIIC 2021)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (IEEE ICAIIC 2021)</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (IEEE ICAIIC 2021)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lalbakhsh, Pooia</author><author>Zaeri, Bahram</author><author>Fesharaki, Mehdi N.</author><author>Sohrabi, Nasrin</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Demiralp, M.</author><author>Mikhael, W.

The emergent improvements of a swarm-based system depend on the selected architecture and the appropriate assignments of the system parameters. To have an improved system, swarm characteristics such as agents/individuals, groups/clusters and communication/interactions should be appropriately characterized according to the system mission. Simulation is one of the best processes to monitor the efficiency of each systems' functionality before its real implementation. Because of the novel and special nature of swarm-based systems, a clear roadmap toward swarm simulation is needed and the process of assigning and evaluating the important parameters should be introduced. This paper in going to determine the important swarm characteristics in simulation phase and explain evaluation methods for important swarm parameters. It also introduces simulation methods of the swarm sub-systems in an artificial world. To clarify the proposed strategies, the AntNet routing algorithm simulation and performance evaluation process is studied according to the proposed methods.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: ACMOS '08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, MODELLING AND SIMULATION&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: ACMOS '08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, MODELLING AND SIMULATION</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>Athens</custom1><custom3>ACMOS '08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, MODELLING AND SIMULATION</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Changsun</author><author>Lee, Meonghun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Swarm-Intelligence-Centric Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5164</pages><volume>20</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>wireless sensor networks</keyword><keyword>swarm intelligence</keyword><keyword>AODV</keyword><keyword>ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>routing algorithm</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>SEP 2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s20185164</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The swarm intelligence (SI)-based bio-inspired algorithm demonstrates features of heterogeneous individual agents, such as stability, scalability, and adaptability, in distributed and autonomous environments. The said algorithm will be applied to the communication network environment to overcome the limitations of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Herein, the swarm-intelligence-centric routing algorithm (SICROA) is presented for use in WSNs that aim to leverage the advantages of the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The proposed routing protocol addresses the problems of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and improves routing performance via collision avoidance, link-quality prediction, and maintenance methods. The proposed method was found to improve network performance by replacing the periodic "Hello" message with an interrupt that facilitates the prediction and detection of link disconnections. Consequently, the overall network performance can be further improved by prescribing appropriate procedures for processing each control message. Therefore, it is inferred that the proposed SI-based approach provides an optimal solution to problems encountered in a complex environment, while operating in a distributed manner and adhering to simple rules of behavior.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Si-wei</author><author>Chen, Jing</author><author>Shen, Lin-Cheng</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Mahadevan, V.</author><author>Jianhong, Z.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A MAS-based negotiation model and its application to multiple observation collaborative satellite planning</title><secondary-title>2nd International Conference on Computer and Automation Engineering (ICCAE)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2010 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERING (ICCAE 2010), VOL 3</full-title></periodical><pages>205-208</pages><keywords><keyword>extended contract net protocol</keyword><keyword>mixed Multi-Attribute decision</keyword><keyword>dynamic task allocation</keyword><keyword>MAS-based negotiation</keyword><keyword>multi-satellite collaborative planning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-5569-0</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5452066</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A multiple agent system(MAS) architecture is constructed for multiple satellites collaborative planning system(MSCPS).

The proposed algorithm exploits the advantages of the ultraviolet scattering communication to maximize the air operation time of the UAV and the efficiency of mission completion. The proposed algorithm improves the threshold of the candidate cluster head selection of non-uniform clustering algorithm by introducing distance and energy. In the inter-cluster communication process, cluster head nodes can select the optimum data transmission route to forward the information to the lead UAV. Compared to LEACH and EEUC, the simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm increases the energy efficiency of the UAV network by 21.02% and 3.92%, respectively. Moreover, the lifetime of the network is extended by 23.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can efficiently balance the energy consumption of the nodes and extend the lifetime of the UAV swarms.</abstract><language>Chinese</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ligot, Antoine</author><author>Kuckling, Jonas</author><author>Bozhinoski, Darko</author><author>Birattari, Mauro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automatic modular design of robot swarms using behavior trees as a control architecture</title><secondary-title>PeerJ COMPUTER SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PeerJ COMPUTER SCIENCE</full-title><abbr-1>PeerJ Comput.

To do so, we introduce Maple, an automatic design method that combines predefined modules-low-level behaviors and conditions-into a behavior tree that encodes the individual behavior of each robot of the swarm. We present three empirical studies based on two missions: AGGREGATION and FORAGING. To explore the strengths and weaknesses of adopting behavior trees as a control architecture, we compare Maple with Chocolate, a previously proposed automatic design method that uses probabilistic finite state machines instead. In the first study, we assess Maple's ability to produce control software that crosses the reality gap satisfactorily. In the second study, we investigate Maple's performance as a function of the design budget, that is, the maximum number of simulation runs that the design process is allowed to perform. In the third study, we explore a number of possible variants of Maple that differ in the constraints imposed on the structure of the behavior trees generated. The results of the three studies indicate that, in the context of swarm robotics, behavior trees might be appealing but in many settings do not produce better solutions than finite state machines.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kang, Min Wook</author><author>Chung, Yun Won</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Efficient Energy Saving Scheme for Base Stations in 5G Networks with Separated Data and Control Planes Using Particle Swarm Optimization</title><secondary-title>ENERGIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENERGIES</full-title><abbr-1>Energies</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1417</pages><volume>10</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>particle swarm optimization (PSO)</keyword><keyword>DESIGN</keyword><keyword>energy saving</keyword><keyword>5G networks</keyword><keyword>GREEN CELLULAR NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>heterogeneous network</keyword><keyword>MECHANISMS</keyword><keyword>separated data and control planes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>SEP 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1996-1073</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/en10091417</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reducing energy consumption of mobile communication networks has gained significant attentions since it takes a major part of the total energy consumption of information and communication technology (ICT). In this paper, we consider 5G networks with heterogeneous macro cells and small cells, where data and control planes are separated. We consider two types of data traffic, i.e., low rate data traffic and high rate data traffic. In basic separation architecture, a macro cell base station (MBS) manages control signals, while a small cell base station (SBS) manages both low rate data traffic and high rate data traffic. In the considered modified separation architecture, an MBS manages control signals and low rate data traffic, while an SBS manages high rate data traffic. Then, an efficient energy saving scheme for base stations (BSs) is proposed, where the state of a BS is determined depending on the number of user equipments (UEs) that request high rate data traffic and the number of UEs that exist under the overlapping areas commonly covered by the considered BS and the neighbor BSs. We formulate an optimization problem for the proposed energy saving scheme and obtain the solution using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Numerical results show that the proposed energy saving scheme in the modified separated network architecture has better energy efficiency compared to the conventional energy saving schemes in both basic and modified separated network architectures. Also, the proposed energy saving scheme has lower aggregate delay.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bechlioulis, Charalampos P.</author><author>Kyriakopoulos, Kostas J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Collaborative Multi-Robot Transportation in Obstacle-Cluttered Environments via Implicit Communication</title><secondary-title>FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI</full-title><abbr-1>Front.

In particular, we consider a decentralized leader-follower architecture for multiple mobile manipulators, where the leading robot, which has exclusive knowledge of both the object's desired configuration and the position of the obstacles in the workspace, tries to navigate the overall formation to the desired configuration while at the same time it avoids collisions with the obstacles. On the other hand, the followers estimate the objects desired trajectory profile via novel prescribed performance estimation laws that drive the estimation errors to an arbitrarily small predefined residual set. Moreover, a navigation function-based scheme is innovatively combined with adaptive control to deal with parametric uncertainty. Hence, the current state of the art in robust motion planning and collision avoidance is extended by studying second order non-linear dynamics with parametric uncertainty. Furthermore, the feedback relies exclusively on each robot's force/torque, position as well as velocity measurements and no explicit information is exchanged online among the robots, thus reducing the required communication bandwidth and increasing robustness.

In the SoS oriented design, the subsystems performance trade-off is the basis of design decisions. In the trade-off for surveillance missions, most previous works do not consider track reporting and mainly focus on the design of platforms. An improved method for the subsystems performance trade-off in the SoS oriented UAV swarm design is proposed. Within an improved design framework with subsystems disaggregation, this method is characterized by treating platforms, sensors, and communications as equally important subsystems, integrating operational strategies into the trade-off, and enabling the trade-off for track reporting. Those advantages are achieved by a behavior-based modular model structure for agent-based operational modeling and simulation. In addition, a method of analyzing the bounds of the communication range is also presented. Simulation experiments are conducted by using precision-based simulation replication rules and surrogate modeling methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that the configuration of area partitioning changes the trade space of subsystems performances, indicating the necessity of integrating operational strategies into the conceptual design.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Xiaolin</author><author>Fu, Xiuwen</author><author>Yang, Yongsheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy-Efficient Trajectory Planning Algorithm Based on Multi-Objective PSO for the Mobile Sink in Wireless Sensor Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>176204-176217</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>trajectory planning</keyword><keyword>SYSTEM</keyword><keyword>DESIGN</keyword><keyword>PROTOCOL</keyword><keyword>load balance of rendezvous nodes</keyword><keyword>Mobile sink</keyword><keyword>MOPSO</keyword><keyword>WSNS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957834</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), collecting data with mobile sinks is an effective way to solve the "energy hole problem''. However, most of existing algorithms of mobile sinks ignore the load balance of rendezvous nodes, which will significantly shorten the network lifetime. Moreover, most mobile sinks are usually required to visit locations of sensor nodes without taking advantage of their communication ranges. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-efficient trajectory planning algorithm (EETP) based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) to shorten the trajectory length of the mobile sink and balance the load of rendezvous nodes. EETP aims to reduce the delay in data delivery and prolong the network lifetime. To shorten the trajectory length of the mobile sink, we design a mechanism to select potential visiting points within communication overlapping ranges of sensor nodes, rather than locations of sensor nodes. Additionally, according to trajectory characteristics of the mobile sink, we design an effective trajectory encoding method that can generate a trajectory containing an unfixed number of visiting points. The simulation results show that the proposed EETP is superior to existing WRP, CB and the MOPSO-based algorithm, in terms of delay in data delivery, network lifetime and energy consumption.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Soon-gyo</author><author>Kang, Byungseok</author><author>Yeoum, Sanggil</author><author>Choo, Hyunseung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trail-Using Ant Behavior Based Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is one of the popular algorithms in SI. In the last decade, several routing protocols based on ACO algorithm have been developed for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Such routing protocols are very flexible in distributed system but generate a lot of additional traffic and thus increase communication overhead. This paper proposes a new routing protocol reducing the overhead to provide energy efficiency. The proposed protocol adopts not only the foraging behavior of ant colony but also the trail-using behavior which has never been adopted in routing. By employing the behaviors, the protocol establishes and manages the routing trails energy efficiently in the whole network. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol has low communication overhead and reduces up to 55% energy consumption compared to the existing ACO algorithm.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuru, Kaya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Planning the Future of Smart Cities With Swarms of Fully Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using a Novel Framework</title><secondary-title>IEEE ACCESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ACCESS</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Access</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6571-6595</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Drones</keyword><keyword>Task analysis</keyword><keyword>Batteries</keyword><keyword>Internet of Things</keyword><keyword>Internet of Things (IoT)</keyword><keyword>Automation</keyword><keyword>Automation of Everything (AoE)</keyword><keyword>Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)</keyword><keyword>Internet of Everything (IoE)</keyword><keyword>Internet-of-Drones (IoD)</keyword><keyword>smart city</keyword><keyword>Real-time systems</keyword><keyword>Particle swarm optimization</keyword><keyword>NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>ARCHITECTURE</keyword><keyword>DESIGN</keyword><keyword>CHALLENGES</keyword><keyword>DEPLOYMENT</keyword><keyword>OPPORTUNITIES</keyword><keyword>INTERNET</keyword><keyword>RESOURCE-ALLOCATION</keyword><keyword>UAV COMMUNICATION</keyword><keyword>WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-3536</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3049094</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - self-governing in the aerospace discipline has been a remarkable research area with the development of the advanced bespoke microcontrollers embedded with advanced AI techniques for the last several decades. The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghdiri, Oussama</author><author>Jaafar, Wael</author><author>Alfattani, Safwan</author><author>Abderrazak, Jihene Ben</author><author>Yanikomeroglu, Halim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Offline and Online UAV-Enabled Data Collection in Time-Constrained IoT Networks</title><secondary-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Trans.

Particularly, time-sensitive and energy-limited IoT networks located in hard-to-reach areas require efficient/cost-effective data collection solution. To address this matter, we consider a multi-UAV enabled IoT network, where several UAVs collect data from time-constrained sensor nodes (SNs). In our framework, SNs are managed by cluster heads (CHs), then UAVs collect data from them. We formulate the problem of minimizing system's deployment costs and operating energy to collect data within deadlines, subject to communication, UAVs mission time, and battery capacity constraints. To solve it, we propose a two-step approach. In the first step, an efficient K-means based method groups SNs and deploys CHs. Then, UAV-based offline and online data collection methods are proposed. In the offline setting where the system's status is known beforehand, UAV paths are determined using near-optimal meta-heuristics. In simulations, the nearest-neighbor and Tabu search provided best offline performances, conditioned on the system's parameters. In the online setting where no system information is available, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approaches are proposed. Results demonstrate the superiority of the actor-critic solution.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, Yuan</author><author>Shao, Chunfu</author><author>Cao, Zhichao</author><author>Chen, Wenxin</author><author>Yin, Anteng</author><author>Yue, Hao</author><author>Xie, Binglei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Urban Rail Transit Passenger Flow Forecasting Method Based on the Coupling of Artificial Fish Swarm and Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms</title><secondary-title>SUSTAINABILITY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SUSTAINABILITY</full-title><abbr-1>Sustainability</abbr-1></periodical><pages>7230</pages><volume>11</volume><number>24</number><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>AFSA-PSO algorithm</keyword><keyword>large-scale tourist attractions passenger flow</keyword><keyword>normal passenger flow</keyword><keyword>subway passenger flow prediction</keyword><keyword>urban traffic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>DEC 2 2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2071-1050</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/su11247230</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Urban rail transit passenger flow forecasting is an important basis for station design, passenger flow organization, and train operation plan optimization. In this work, we combined the artificial fish swarm and improved particle swarm optimization (AFSA-PSO) algorithms. Taking the Window of the World station of the Shenzhen Metro Line 1 as an example, subway passenger flow prediction research was carried out. The AFSA-PSO algorithm successfully preserved the fast convergence and strong traceability of the original algorithm through particle self-adjustment and dynamic weights, and it effectively overcame its shortcomings, such as the tendency to fall into local optimum and lower convergence speed. In addition to accurately predicting normal passenger flow, the algorithm can also effectively identify and predict the large-scale tourist attractions passenger flow as it has strong applicability and robustness.

In a green network, energy saving of network nodes such as base stations (BSs), switches, and servers should be achieved efficiently. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous network architecture in 5G networks with separated data and control planes, where basically a macro cell manages control signals and a small cell manages data traffic. Then, we propose an optimized handover scheme based on context information such as reference signal received power, speed of user equipment (UE), traffic load, call admission control level, and data type. In this paper, the main objective of the proposed optimal handover is either to reduce the number of handovers or the total energy consumption of BSs. To this end, we develop optimization problems with either the minimization of the number of total handovers or the minimization of energy consumption of BSs as the objective function of the optimization problem. The solution of the optimization problem is obtained by particle swarm optimization, since the developed optimization problem is an NP hard problem. Performance analysis results via simulation based on various probability distributions of the characteristics of UE and BS show that the proposed optimized handover based on context information performs better than the previous call admission control based handover scheme, from the perspective of the number of handovers and total energy consumption. We also show that the proposed handover scheme can efficiently reduce either the number of handovers or the total energy consumption by applying either handover minimization or energy minimization depending on the objective of the application.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Jeong-Sik</author><author>Na, Hyeong-Ju</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Front-End of Vehicle-Embedded Speech Recognition for Voice-Driven Multi-UAVs Control</title><secondary-title>APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL</full-title><abbr-1>Appl.

Such systems require efficient front-end processing, including noise reduction and voice trigger. For reliable speech recognition, it is necessary to handle the usage environments. In this study, we target voice-driven multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) control. Although many studies have introduced several systems for voice-driven UAV control, most have focused on a general speech recognition architecture to control a single UAV. However, for stable voice-controlled driving, it is essential to handle the environmental conditions of UAVs carefully, including environmental noise that deteriorates recognition accuracy, and the operating scheme, e.g., how to direct a target vehicle among multiple UAVs and switch targets using speech commands. To handle these issues, we propose an efficient vehicle-embedded speech recognition front-end for multi-UAV control via voice. First, we propose a noise reduction approach that considers non-stationary noise in outdoor environments. The proposed method improves the conventional minimum mean squared error (MMSE) approach to handle non-stationary noises, e.g., babble and vehicle noises. In addition, we propose a multi-channel voice trigger method that can control multiple UAVs while efficiently directing and switching the target vehicle via speech commands. We evaluated the proposed methods on speech corpora, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the conventional approaches. In trigger word detection experiments, our approach yielded approximately 7%, 12%, and 3% relative improvements over spectral subtraction, adaptive comb filtering, and the conventional MMSE, respectively. In addition, the proposed multi-channel voice trigger approach achieved approximately 51% relative improvement over the conventional approach based on a single trigger word.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Durrani, Mehr Yahya</author><author>Tariq, Rehan</author><author>Aadil, Farhan</author><author>Maqsood, Muazzam</author><author>Nam, Yunyoung</author><author>Muhammad, Khan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptive Node Clustering Technique for Smart Ocean under Water Sensor Network (SOSNET)</title><secondary-title>SENSORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SENSORS</full-title><abbr-1>Sensors</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1145</pages><volume>19</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>optimization</keyword><keyword>clustering</keyword><keyword>routing</keyword><keyword>ALGORITHM</keyword><keyword>OPTIMIZATION</keyword><keyword>ROUTING PROTOCOL</keyword><keyword>LIFETIME</keyword><keyword>moth flame optimizer</keyword><keyword>smart ocean</keyword><keyword>transmission range optimization</keyword><keyword>underwater communication and networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>MAR 1 2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1424-8220</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/s19051145</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Smart ocean is a term broadly used for monitoring the ocean surface, sea habitat monitoring, and mineral exploration to name a few. Development of an efficient routing protocol for smart oceans is a non-trivial task because of various challenges, such as presence of tidal waves, multiple sources of noise, high propagation delay, and low bandwidth. In this paper, we have proposed a routing protocol named adaptive node clustering technique for smart ocean underwater sensor network (SOSNET). SOSNET employs a moth flame optimizer (MFO) based technique for selecting a near optimal number of clusters required for routing. MFO is a bio inspired optimization technique, which takes into account the movement of moths towards light. The SOSNET algorithm is compared with other bio inspired algorithms such as comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), and gray wolf optimization (GWO). All these algorithms are used for routing optimization. The performance metrics used for this comparison are transmission range of nodes, node density, and grid size. These parameters are varied during the simulation, and the results indicate that SOSNET performed better than other algorithms.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Shasha</author><author>Peng, Xinyu</author><author>Pang, Ruiqiu</author><author>Li, Li</author><author>Song, Zixuan</author><author>Ye, Hongying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Information Preference and Information Supply Efficiency Evaluation before, during, and after an Earthquake: Evidence from Songyuan, China</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

There is little information available in the literature regarding information preference from an individual's need perspective, and there is a lack of differentiation in evaluation between information need and supply. Under the guidance of the crisis stage analysis theory, using multiple response analysis and weighted analysis methods, this study explores earthquake disaster information content and communication channel preferences, and develops an information deviation index (IDI) to evaluate the efficiency of risk communication before, during, and after an earthquake. A questionnaire-based survey of 918 valid respondents in Songyuan, China, which had been hit by a small earthquake swarm, was conducted to provide practical evidence for this study. The results indicated the following. Firstly, the information needs of individuals are highly differentiated in the different stages of an earthquake. From pre-disaster to post-disaster, individuals show a shift in information need from "preparedness and response knowledge" to "disaster information", then to "disaster information and disaster relief information" in parallel, to "reconstruction and reflection information". Based on the above analysis, a composition of the main earthquake disaster information is proposed for different stages. Secondly, by measuring the values of the IDI, we found that most individuals' information needs were met for the earthquake. Thirdly, the TV and the internet were the two preferred commutation channels for acquiring disaster information from among all the effective channels in all the stages.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Shasha</author><author>Zhai, Guofang</author><author>Zhou, Shutian</author><author>Fan, Chenjing</author><author>Wu, Yunqing</author><author>Ren, Chongqiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insight into the Earthquake Risk Information Seeking Behavior of the Victims: Evidence from Songyuan, China</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

Efficient risk communication aims at improving the supply of risk information and fulfilling the need for risk information by individuals. Therefore, an investigation into individual-level information seeking behavior within earthquake risk contexts is very important for improved earthquake risk communication. However, at present there are very few studies that have explored the behavior of individuals seeking earthquake risk information. Under the guidance of the Risk Information Seeking and Processing model as well as relevant practical findings using the structural equation model, this study attempts to explore the main determinants of an individual's earthquake risk information seeking behavior, and to validate the mediator effect of information need during the seeking process. A questionnaire-based survey of 918 valid respondents in Songyuan, China, who had been hit by a small earthquake swarm, was used to provide practical evidence for this study. Results indicated that information need played a noteworthy role in the earthquake risk information seeking process, and was detected both as an immediate predictor and as a mediator. Informational subjective norms drive the seeking behavior on earthquake risk information through both direct and indirect approaches.

This makes them notably light weight and suitable for dynamic service deployment at the network edge and Internet of Things (IoT) devices for reduced latency and energy consumption. Data collection, computation, and now intelligence is included in variety of IoT devices which have very tight latency and energy consumption conditions. Recent studies satisfy latency condition through containerized services deployment on IoT devices and gateways. They fail to account for the limited energy and computing resources of these devices which limit the scalability and concurrent services deployment. This paper aims to establish guidelines and identify critical factors for containerized services deployment on resource constrained IoT devices. For this purpose, two container orchestration tools (i.e., Docker Swarm and Kubernetes) are tested and compared on a baseline IoT gateways testbed. Experiments use Deep Learning driven data analytics and Intrusion Detection System services, and evaluate the time it takes to prepare and deploy a container (creation time), Central Processing Unit (CPU) utilization for concurrent containers deployment, memory usage under different traffic loads, and energy consumption. The results indicate that container creation time and memory usage are decisive factors for containerized micro service architecture.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Farhad, Arshad</author><author>Kim, Dae-Ho</author><author>Pyun, Jae-Young</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scalability of LoRaWAN in an Urban Environment: A Simulation Study</title><secondary-title>11th International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2019 ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS AND FUTURE NETWORKS (ICUFN 2019)</full-title></periodical><pages>677-681</pages><keywords><keyword>Internet of Things</keyword><keyword>LoRaWAN</keyword><keyword>capacity</keyword><keyword>scalability</keyword><keyword>spreading factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-72811-339-5</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/icufn.2019.8806140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) communication protocol can be adapted for the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its long geographical coverage, low energy consumption, high capacity, open business model, and low cost. Recently, both academia and industry are attracted to LoRaWAN because of its recent developments and applicability in the IoT environment. Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio. We also observed that the use of acknowledgment limits the scalability of the LoRaWAN due to the duty cycle constraints. However, this study further reveals that elevating the antenna height can significantly improve the performance in an urban area.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS AND FUTURE NETWORKS (ICUFN 2019)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS AND FUTURE NETWORKS (ICUFN 2019)</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2019 ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS AND FUTURE NETWORKS (ICUFN 2019)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thaniyath, Gousia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Efficient Trust-Based Routing Model for Clustered-Based Hetrogeneous Wireless Sensor Network</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS DATA COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS DATA COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

The open deployment, energy constraint, and lack of centralized administration makes WSN very vulnerable to various kinds of malicious attacks. In WSN, identifying malicious sensor device and eliminating their sensed information play very important roles for mission critical applications. Standard cryptography and authentication schemes cannot be directly used in WSN because of the resource constraint nature of sensor devices. Thus, energy efficient and low latency methodology is required for minimizing the impact of malicious sensor devices.

Thus, they aid in achieving better security, packet transmission, and energy efficiency performance. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed SLBR model over existing trust-based routing model, namely exponential cat swarm optimization (ECSO).

Subsequently, extensive research has been conducted to achieve the improved performance for recognition of human actions. Human activity recognition has various real time applications, such as patient monitoring in which patients are being monitored among a group of normal people and then identified based on their abnormal activities. Our goal is to render a multi class abnormal action detection in individuals as well as in groups from video sequences to differentiate multiple abnormal human actions. In this paper, You Look only Once (YOLO) network is utilized as a backbone CNN model. For training the CNN model, we constructed a large dataset of patient videos by labeling each frame with a set of patient actions and the patient's positions. We retrained the back-bone CNN model with 23,040 labeled images of patient's actions for 32 epochs. Across each frame, the proposed model allocated a unique confidence score and action label for video sequences by finding the recurrent action label. The present study shows that the accuracy of abnormal action recognition is 96.8%. Our proposed approach differentiated abnormal actions with improved F1-Score of 89.2% which is higher than state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the proposed framework can be beneficial to hospitals and elder care homes for patient monitoring.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thahniyath, Gousia</author><author>Jayaprasad, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Secure and load balanced routing model for wireless sensor networks</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The network architecture is also increasing with the accuracy. But the bigger size and resource intensive training makes this model impractical to deploy in IoT based computational units. IoT has limited resources and reckoning power. So smaller network with same accuracy is highly priced for IoT based application deployment. In this study, convolutional deeplearning neural network and how pruning filters without compromising accuracy was studied. Efficient result was achieved from the pruned deeplearning neural network. the model was configured in the experiments by pruning the filter based on absolution position of zeros value based filter ranking. SCADA applications with intelligent component to detect data abnormality and remote sensing also required neural network applications. Using compact memory efficient module in such machines will also give proper validation in such applications in real time. In the end, proposed method for the pruned network delivered same accuracy with reduced size and thus archiving memory and computation for small sized application.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (ICAIIC 2019)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2019 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (ICAIIC 2019)</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2019 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION (ICAIIC 2019)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tama, Bayu Adhi</author><author>Im, Sun</author><author>Lee, Seungchul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving an Intelligent Detection System for Coronary Heart Disease Using a Two-Tier Classifier Ensemble</title><secondary-title>BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL</full-title><abbr-1>Biomed Res.

It is the most frequent cause of mortality across the globe due to the lack of a healthy lifestyle. Owing to the fact that a heart attack occurs without any apparent symptoms, an intelligent detection method is inescapable. In this article, a new CHD detection method based on a machine learning technique, e.g., classifier ensembles, is dealt with. A two-tier ensemble is built, where some ensemble classifiers are exploited as base classifiers of another ensemble. A stacked architecture is designed to blend the class label prediction of three ensemble learners, i.e., random forest, gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting. The detection model is evaluated on multiple heart disease datasets, i.e., Z-Alizadeh Sani, Statlog, Cleveland, and Hungarian, corroborating the generalisability of the proposed model. A particle swarm optimization-based feature selection is carried out to choose the most significant feature set for each dataset. Finally, a two-fold statistical test is adopted to justify the hypothesis, demonstrating that the performance differences of classifiers do not rely upon an assumption. Our proposed method outperforms any base classifiers in the ensemble with respect to 10-fold cross validation. Our detection model has performed better than current existing models based on traditional classifier ensembles and individual classifiers in terms of accuracy, F1, and AUC. This study demonstrates that our proposed model adds a considerable contribution compared to the prior published studies in the current literature.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mok, Seung-chan</author><author>Kim, Gon-woo</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Unger, H.</author><author>Kim, J.</author><author>Kang, U.</author><author>SoIn, C.</author><author>Du, J.</author><author>Saad, W.</author><author>Ha, Y.

In particular, LiDAR is widely used in mobile mapping systems (MMS) for building high -definition (HD) map. Not only range but also intensity are useful data for extracting road marking and surface data from sensor. However, LiDAR intensity is affected by surface reflecting characteristic as well as range, incidence angle, atmospheric transmittance and others. Therefore, LiDAR intensity model is difficult to reproduce in simulation environments. In this paper, we proposed realistic intensity rendering method with simulator by generative adversarial network (GAN) trained with unannotated real data. We develop LiDAR projection preprocessing method for operating convolution networks. Our approach have advantage to preserve sensor characteristic and to reduce projection scale loss. We modified CycleGAN architecture to render intensity with unpaired real and synthetic data. Our rendered results show possibility of image-based approach for LiDAR and potential for generating LiDAR dataset by using simulator. Especially, we expect to utilize for military vehicle that has difficulty to reproduce the environments.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND SMART COMPUTING (BIGCOMP 2021)&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;periodical: 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND SMART COMPUTING (BIGCOMP 2021)</research-notes><language>English</language><custom1>New York</custom1><custom3>2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND SMART COMPUTING (BIGCOMP 2021)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aminanto, Muhamad Erza</author><author>Choi, Rakyong</author><author>Tanuwidjaja, Harry Chandra</author><author>Yoo, Paul D.</author><author>Kim, Kwangjo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep Abstraction and Weighted Feature Selection for Wi-Fi Impersonation Detection</title><secondary-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY</full-title><abbr-1>IEEE Trans.

The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.</abstract><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference
